A series of unexplained accidents happen at a submarine platform 6,000 meters beneath the surface and, in response, a group of scientists and cadres are sent to investigate. Before long, the members of the party start to get haunted by horrifying, elusive visions... and the rash of brutal deaths once again resumes. Is it just a collection of freak accidents and hallucinations caused by sheer paranoia, the claustrophobic environment and dysbarism... or is there really something more lurking in this abyssal station?\n\n(Source: jCafe24)",

Naturally, Tsumugi is wary of leaving Sei and his sister to their own devices, and he has a quick chat with Sei to assert that he won't tolerate any shameful behavior. Sei agrees―but teenage zeal is a difficult thing to control.\n\nEvery time Tsumugi looks away for too long, Futaba and Sei get a little closer, exchanging smiles and holding hands discreetly. Thanks to their cute little escapades, Futaba finds herself helplessly falling for Sei. But as their interactions rapidly grow more intimate, Futaba wonders if Sei's affection might just be too much for her to handle!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This is what Mori Buntarou trains, works, and lives for.\n\nHis climb to the top starts when he transfers to a new high school. Despite his lonesome and solitary nature, Mori's classmates persuade him to climb the school building. Without a harness or hesitation, he begins his scale to reach the top. Edging past the point of no return, he halts when he is faced with a final intimidating obstacle—a horizontal overhang. Adrenaline courses through him, and Mori jumps for the final hold at the summit.\n\nFrom there, he casts his eyes upon something that he normally would not have seen—another peak, another goal. With an awakened passion and newfound purpose in life, Mori explores the breathtaking sport of rock climbing.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When a friend introduces her to an unorthodox, backstreet art class taught by the strong-armed Kenzou Hidaka, called simply as \"sensei,\" Akiko decides to enroll, expecting an easy ride and an automatic improvement in her art skills. To her chagrin, what she gets is something else entirely—a tough, demanding, and uncompromising teacher with absolutely no interest in manga.\n\nBut when Akiko takes up Sensei's challenge of an intense schedule, she comes to recognize how much he cares about his students and forms a close bond with him. With Sensei's guidance, Akiko learns what is necessary to become a successful mangaka as well as what it means to be an adult.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As a result, Suiren now rarely speaks and maintains an expressionless face.\n\nAdvancing to high school, Suiren returns to a co-ed school and is once again the center of attention. The boys refer to her as \"Takane no Hana,\" flower on a high peak, unreachable and idolized from afar. However, one boy outside her sea of admirers catches her eye—Kouha Kawasumi, a talented karate student who is just as quiet as her. While he may not return her immediate affection, Kouha saves her from a group of boys, jump-starting the heartwarming romance that blossoms between the two soft-spoken youths.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis":"Hidden in plain sight, an age-old conflict rages on. Supernatural monsters known as \"Curses\" terrorize humanity from the shadows, and powerful humans known as \"Jujutsu\" sorcerers use mystical arts to exterminate them. When high school student Yuuji Itadori finds a dried-up finger of the legendary Curse Sukuna Ryoumen, he suddenly finds himself joining this bloody conflict.\n\nAttacked by a Curse attracted to the finger's power, Yuuji makes a reckless decision to protect himself, gaining the power to combat Curses in the process but also unwittingly unleashing the malicious Sukuna into the world once more. Though Yuuji can control and confine Sukuna to his own body, the Jujutsu world classifies Yuuji as a dangerous, high-level Curse who must be exterminated.\n\nDetained and sentenced to death, Yuuji meets Satoru Gojou—a teacher at Jujutsu High School—who explains that despite his imminent execution, there is an alternative for him. Being a rare vessel to Sukuna, if Yuuji were to die, then Sukuna would perish too. Therefore, if Yuuji were to consume the many other remnants of Sukuna, then Yuuji's subsequent execution would truly eradicate the malicious demon. Taking up this chance to make the world safer and live his life for a little longer, Yuuji enrolls in Jujutsu High, jumping headfirst into a harsh and unforgiving battlefield.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, unlike other schools, students at Hyakkaou do not pride themselves on academic achievement. Instead, they value strategic prowess and the ability to read people. Come nightfall, many places on campus transform into gambling dens overseen by the student council, where players compete for rank, money, and more.\n\nRyouta Suzui spends his days as a \"house pet\"—a student ranked in the bottom one hundred, forced to serve his peers. His circumstances soon change when a mysterious new transfer student, Yumeko Jabami, arrives at the academy. Despite Suzui's warnings, Yumeko quickly becomes immersed in the school's gambling scene, facing off against several high-profile opponents. Her exploits draw the attention of the student council members, who start meddling in her affairs. Suzui tries his best to keep Yumeko out of trouble, but to his chagrin, she turns out to be the type of person best suited to attend Hyakkaou: a compulsive gambler.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After a tumultuous childhood, he finally finds someone he respects and believes he can trust, only to have everything fall apart when this person takes away everything important to Guts for the purpose of fulfilling his own desires. Now marked for death, Guts becomes condemned to a fate in which he is relentlessly pursued by demonic beings.\n\nSetting out on a dreadful quest riddled with misfortune, Guts, armed with a massive sword and monstrous strength, will let nothing stop him, not even death itself, until he is finally able to take the head of the one who stripped him—and his loved one—of their humanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 14: Berserk: The Prototype",

Kei, on the other hand, can talk to cars and prefers their company to humans—especially women. After moving to Iceland, Kei makes a living there as a freelance detective.\n\nWhether it be resolving lovers' quarrels, locating missing people, or recovering lost items, Kei hops from case to case, traveling alone on the empty roads that span the rugged Icelandic landscape. But the secrets of the land of ice and fire are not the only mysteries ahead that Kei must unravel: an encounter with an aloof Icelandic beauty makes him recall local superstitions of ghosts that roam the wild lands at night.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Those who could not make it to the island sank to the bottom of the ocean, where, over time, they slowly turned to crystal. As countless millennia passed, 28 of these crystallized lifeforms, known as the Lustrous, rose from the depths and resided on the island. Led by the wise Kongou-sensei, they must defend themselves against the seemingly infinite number of Lunarians, inhabitants of the moons who seek to harvest their valuable bodies for crafting weapons and jewelry. \n\nHouseki no Kuni centers around Phosphophyllite, a young gem about to turn three hundred years old. Clumsy, extremely fragile, and having no visible talent, they are one of the weakest gems around, unable to help in the fight against the Lunarians in any meaningful way. But as the battle with the otherworldly invaders rages on, they soon learn that power comes at a cost that no one should have to pay.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis":"\"A big brother must always stay ahead of his younger brother. That is my responsibility as the older sibling\"—these are the words that have always motivated Mutta Nanba to try his best when it came to his younger brother Hibito. So naturally, in the summer of 2006 when the Nanba brothers witness something strange in the night sky, Hibito declared that he would become an astronaut and travel to the Moon, while Mutta countered with the affirmation that he would go to Mars. That was the promise they made to each other.\n\nNow in 2025, while Hibito is working with NASA and preparing to become the first Japanese to land on the moon, Mutta has been fired from his job in an automotive development company. Having difficulty finding another job, Mutta is given a lifetime opportunity when he receives a letter from JAXA—the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency—telling him that he's been accepted to participate in the next astronaut selection. As if fate has given him a chance to fulfill the promise he made all those years ago, Mutta undertakes the difficult challenge of going to space.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis":"It is the Middle Ages, and the remnants of mankind are plagued by paranoia and death. Spoken in fearful whispers, the word \"Yoma\" cuts a clear image into the minds of all: monstrous beings with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. But fear of their gruesome appetite is dwarfed by that of their ability to shapeshift and steal the memories of their last meal. Forever vulnerable to attack, humans live in unease, even among family.\n\nThere are few means to kill a Yoma. The Organization, informally known as \"Claymore,\" is humanity's only line of defense, dispatching half-human, half-Yoma female warriors to purify villages of Yoma. A lonely and dangerous existence, death for these warriors comes with each new assignment. What time is found between trying battles and long, arduous travels is spent in ever-intensifying struggle to resist their Yoma blood and maintain their humanity. Villagers, knowing of this, pay for their security reluctantly and have only loathsome regard for their protectors.\n\nClaymore follows the stoic and low-ranking member Clare in her daunting trek as she searches for personal vengeance. Along the way, she encounters many unexpected things about the world, from the camaraderie and hope held fast by her sisters-in-arms to the sinister truth behind the Claymore Organization.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In contrast to her, Taichi Mashima, the son of a surgeon, is gifted yet insecure as he is burdened by the heavy expectations of his strict mother, who wants him to be perfect in everything. However, the lives of Chihaya and Taichi soon change as they encounter Arata Wataya, the new transfer student in their class.\n\nInspired by Arata's dream to become the best at competitive karuta—a card game based on the classic anthology of one hundred Japanese poets—Chihaya quickly falls in love with the game. Refusing to lose to the talented Arata, the prideful Taichi joins along and immerses himself in the game, aiming to one day surpass his fated rival. The three friends spend their childhood practicing karuta everyday, until certain circumstances force them to part with each other.\n\nA few years later, now in high school, the trio finds themselves reunited through the world of competitive karuta. Alongside their newfound comrades and rivals, they embark on a journey of self-discovery, friendship, and romance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

On her first day, Ichinose meets her neighbor Sarasa Ando in the girls' dormitory, but she accidentally breaks Sarasa's project for an art exhibit. As recompense, Ichinose is asked to photograph boys in the boys' dormitory; however, she is saved from that humiliating fate thanks to Akatsuki Saji. Ichinose initially thinks Akatsuki to be friendly, but she later finds his demeanor cold after conversing with him. However, to her surprise, Akatsuki chooses Ichinose to be his partner for the school festival. And so, despite not always getting along, the two begin to form a close bond through their shared passion for painting.\n\nCrayon Days: Daikirai na Aitsu follows the cheerful Ichinose as she pursues her goal of creating extraordinary paintings, and the astute Akatsuki as he searches for the thing that his paintings lack. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

At first glance, the pair seem detached from the masses, excelling at the top of their class. The tall and beautiful Kanata has a strict aura around her that discourages boys from talking to her, while Kazuki's refined yet friendly playfulness prevents girls from interacting with him.\n\nThe truth is that—underneath this facade—both Kanata and Kazuki are just 14-year-olds in love with each other.

This wish is exceedingly optimistic due to Chiyuki's heart condition, which increases the risk of seizures and decreases her life expectancy. The doctor who presided over her birth said she would be lucky to live 15 years.\n\nChiyuki is 17 years old when she meets the unlikely vampire Touya Kanou. He claims to hate blood, and he refuses to find a human partner with whom to share the rest of his life. Touya is 18 now, but if he took blood continually from a partner, then they both might live to be a thousand years old. \n\nChiyuki immediately volunteers to be Touya's partner, but he shoves her away in disgust, inadvertently learning of her poor health when she starts to spasm. Touya treats Chiyuki more kindly after that, but still refuses to drink her blood. She begins to suspect that there is a different reason why he keeps turning her down, but will she live long enough to discover the truth?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Isshunkan no Romance (A Romance of One Moment)",

            "synopsis":"During the Warring States period in China, Xin and Piao are two brother-like youngsters who dream of becoming Great Generals, despite their low status as orphaned slaves. One day, they encounter a man of nobility, who gives Piao an opportunity to undertake an important duty within the state of Qin's royal palace. Parting ways, Xin and Piao promise each other to one day become the greatest generals in the world. However, after a fierce coup d'état occurs in the palace, Xin meets with a dying Piao, whose last words spur him into action and lead him to encounter the young and soon-to-be king of Qin, Zheng Ying.\n\nAlthough initially on bad terms, Xin and Zheng become comrades and start on a path filled with trials and bloodshed. Zheng's objective is to bring all the warring states under Qin, and Xin seeks to climb to the very top of the army ranks.

Despite her genuine attempts to befriend her new classmates, Shouko only proves herself to be an annoyance for Shouya and his friends, provoking them to ridicule her at any possible chance. Soon enough, their taunts turn into constant assault—yet the teachers heartlessly remain apathetic to the situation.\n\nShouya's misdeeds are finally stopped when Shouko transfers to another school. Denying their involvement, the entire class puts the blame on Shouya. As the new victim of bullying, Shouya gradually becomes meek and reclusive, being treated with contempt and disregard for years to come.\n\nNow a high school student, Shouya meets Shouko again for the first time in five years. Still tormented by his past actions, Shouya is determined to make amends for his mistakes and confront his trauma—even if he must face arduous obstacles along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As Nanami muses about her future, she runs into a man hanging onto a tree to escape a dog. She rescues him and tells him about her current situation, prompting the man to offer her his home. He believes that Nanami is more suited than him to be the \"Master\" of the house, and thus she takes him up on his offer.\n\nUpon arrival, however, Nanami discovers that said house is actually a dilapidated shrine. She is about to double back when a fox familiar and two shrine spirits stop her, mistaking her for their former master Mikage, the land god of the shrine. Upon realization, Tomoe—the fox familiar—leaves the shrine, refusing to serve Nanami. After a series of events leaves Nanami in grave danger, she summons Tomoe and seals a contract with him to earn his subservience.

After a tragedy leaves the Earl and his wife dead, many are shocked when their son, a young boy named Ciel, claims his place as the new Earl of the Phantomhive house. At first, many perceive him only as a child surrounded by a few eccentric servants. But they soon begin to realize that it is foolish to meddle with Ciel and his demonic butler Sebastian.\n\nTaking place at the end of the 19th century, Kuroshitsuji follows these two as they face countless mysteries and dangers that plague England and threaten the Queen, uncovering the truth about what really happened to Ciel's parents in the process.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Along the way, he becomes ensnared by a monstrous woman hellbent on keeping him as a pet. But soon, he is saved by a clever and crafty thief named Gareki, who has broken into the woman's house to loot it. The two find themselves labeled as wanted criminals and end up entangled in the affairs of \"Circus\"—the country's most powerful defense organization. Circus is responsible for protecting the nation's citizens from entities known as \"varuga\"—monsters who consume human flesh—as well as uncovering the operations of a mysterious organization called Kafka.\n\nCircus has taken an interest in Nai upon learning that the bracelet he possessed turns out to be an old Circus ID. While Nai decides to stay in Circus' care, Gareki struggles to find his place aboard the ship. As their search for Karoku deepens, the pair encounter more dangerous varuga who all seem to gravitate toward Nai.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Surrounded by doting servants and delicious sweets, she led a satisfied life, yet still yearned the love of her parents, who were always too busy to see her. In times of loneliness, she found solace in pastries made by Natsu Azumi, the five-year-old son of the family chef. Natsu's confections were neither particularly tasty nor pretty, yet they filled Komomo with overwhelming warmth.\n\nAfter Natsu leaves with his father for France, Komomo spends the next 10 years in the familiar lap of luxury, until her father's business goes bankrupt. Demoted from a super princess to super poor, Komomo must now work part-time jobs to get by, but her stubborn personality results in her being fired time and time again. Her fortunes begin to change after a chance encounter with Natsu for the first time in a decade, who offers her a job at his confectionery \"Méli-Mélo.\"\n\nThe current Natsu is entirely different from how he used to be: he works Komomo to the bone and berates her for mistakes made. Only his confections have not changed, still suffusing her with the same warmth. With their positions as master and servant reversed, what awaits the two-faced patissier and spoiled princess?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Faced with the unattractive proposition to become his concubine, Shirayuki chops off her hair and flees the country overnight. In her journey deep into the forest, she encounters Zen Wistalia, the prince of the neighboring country of Clarines. When Zen takes a bite out of a poisoned apple that Prince Raji sends in order to recapture Shirayuki, she expertly uses the herbs at her disposal to cure him.\n\nTogether with Zen and his two friends, Kiki and Mitsuhide, Shirayuki travels to Clarines, where she aims to make a life for herself as an apothecary of the royal court. As Zen slowly begins to mean more to her than the prince of her new country, the two of them must learn to work together toward their respective dreams despite the difference in status.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Hachigatsu no Shikisai (Four-season Color of August)\nVolume 2: Bokura wo Tsunaide.

However, his reputation for delinquency and destructiveness precedes him, and most of his fellow students subsequently avoid him like the plague. As his first day of school ends, he is left with two strong thoughts: \"I hate basketball\" and \"I need a girlfriend.\"\n\nHaruko Akagi, ignorant of Hanamichi's history of misbehavior, notices his immense height and unwittingly approaches him, asking whether or not he likes basketball. Overcome by the fact that a girl is speaking to him, the red-haired giant blurts out a yes despite his true feelings. At the gym, Haruko asks if he can do a slam dunk. Though a complete novice, Hanamachi palms the ball and makes the leap...but overshoots, slamming his head into the backboard. Amazed by his near-inhuman physical abilities, Haruko quickly notifies the school's basketball captain of his feat. With this, Hanamichi is unexpectedly thrust into a world of competition for a girl he barely knows, but he soon discovers that there is perhaps more to basketball than he once thought.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
            "background":"Slam Dunk was awarded the 40th Shogakukan Manga Award for best shounen manga in 1994. In a 2006 poll for the 10th Japan Media Arts Festival, the series was voted by Japanese fans as the #1 manga series of all time. With over 120 million copies sold as of 2012, it is one of the most successful manga series to date. Its wide success led to a large increase in the popularity of basketball in Japanese youth. In 2010, Takehiko Inoue received special commendations from the Japan Basketball Association for popularizing basketball in Japan. The series was published in English by Gutsoon! Entertainment under the Raijin Comics Imprint for five volumes from July 2, 2003 to May 5, 2004. After Gutsoon's shutdown, publishing rights to Slam Dunk were purchased by VIZ Media who then republished the series under the Shonen Jump imprint from September 2, 2008 to December 3, 2013.

One day, a girl with a scar on her forehead named Kouko Ishigami, accompanied by a ghost of a tall and friendly man, transfers into his class.\n\nFuuta quickly takes a liking to Kouko, wondering if it might be love at first sight. After waking up crying from a strange dream involving her, he feels a nostalgic connection to Kouko and becomes determined to befriend her. However, a chain of events forces Fuuta to reveal his birthmark to Kouko, to which she declares him to be the enemy of her life. A furious Kouko explains that the two are bound by reincarnation, and that Fuuta's birthmark is a curse she engraved on him in one of their past lives to recognize and eventually defeat him.\n \nKouko brings out a circular object made of flames known as the \"spirit circle\" and attacks Fuuta, pushing him off a flight of stairs. As he falls, Fuuta is thrown back into the insight of one of his previous lives. Spirit Circle chronicles Fuuta's journey back and forth his several past lives as he gradually unravels the mysteries behind his apparent bad blood with Kouko.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Confronting the governments of the world, a yellow tentacled monster boasts that it was the one responsible for the catastrophe, and in a year's time, it will do the same to Earth. Zooming around at Mach 20, the creature makes a peculiar demand: a teaching position at the prestigious Kunugigaoka Junior High School. Desperate to keep the creature in one place, the government agrees, and so the students of Class 3-E find themselves faced with an impossible task—assassinate the creature responsible for destroying the moon.\n\nAlthough the fate of the world now rests on their shoulders, the class has more personal issues to deal with. Trapped at the bottom of Kunugigaoka's hierarchical education system, they face harsh discrimination from both teachers and students alike. Defeatism abound, they don't believe themselves capable of success in daily life, let alone against a monster that surpasses the abilities of any human. But as the enigmatic creature—whom they dub Koro-sensei—educates them in both assassination and academia, the children slowly find the courage to rise up and take aim at their target: the greatest teacher the world has ever seen.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 21: Tokyo Department Sensou Taikenki (Tokyo Department Store War Chronicles)",

Time passed, and this tale became a legend to tell children.\n\nAs the sole princess of Kouka, Yona lives a life of lavish ease. In love with her cousin, Su-won, and protected by her bodyguard, Son Hak, she wants for nothing and remains sheltered from the harrowing reality outside the castle walls. Contrary to this peaceful illusion, Kouka is about to undergo a political upheaval. After her beloved Su-won stages a bloody coup and murders her father, Yona is forced to flee with only Hak by her side.\n\nThough surrounded by enemies on all sides, the banished princess still yearns to save her kingdom. Her solution comes from an exiled priest, who tells her that her only hope is to find the four legendary dragon warriors. Guided by this seemingly fictitious myth, Yona sets out to find these warriors, determined to restore her kingdom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When her classmates speculate upon her transfer to their less-than-impressive school, she flatly informs them that she was expelled for violence against her former teacher. This is characteristic of Maria—despite her angelic appearance, she will tell the unadorned truth regardless of social niceties, and as such, people often compare her to a devil.\n\nOn her first day, Maria is introduced to Yuusuke Kanda and Shin Meguro, two unlikely friends. Yuusuke pretends to be cheerful and fun-loving, but in reality, he is uninterested in many things and people. In contrast, Shin acts cold and distant, but can secretly be quite caring. \n\nYuusuke proposes to Maria that she should put a \"lovely spin\" on the things she says to make her words sound less harsh, even if her message remains the same. Unfortunately, Maria cannot master this \"lovely spin\" when speaking, but people seem to be touched by her voice when she sings. Can singing help Maria convey that she is lonely, that she wants to be liked by others—and most of all—that she wants to be able to like herself?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He also has a crush on his class' idol, the sweet Nanako Saeki. In stark contrast to her, Sawa Nakamura is an insolent and unpleasant girl who lacks any concern for school.\n\nOne day, Takao forgets to bring his book home with him. He returns to school to retrieve it, but is stopped in his tracks when he finds Nanako's freshly worn gym clothes lying on the floor. A strange desire consumes Takao, and like a wicked pervert, he steals them.\n\nWith the guilt of his crime weighing on him, Takao tries his best to live a normal life.

On his right arm, Momiji writes the kanji for \"change.\" Unfortunately, the change he awaits becomes a nightmare when the school is flooded with monsters, killing those unfortunate enough to get in their way.

By now, in the year 1980, the remnants of that forest have been paved over to form the streets of London, England. In these streets, the \"Alleyway Killer\" has been garnering publicity for murdering people and draining them of blood under the cover of night.\n\nOut for a walk one evening, Alan Everett stumbles upon a woman who claims she was being stalked, and who might have been the killer's next intended victim. Beyond being grateful to Alan for saving her, she also seems elated to see him face to face. She introduces herself as Marie Noblue and begs him to take her to his home, since she has no place to call her own. Alan is strangely comfortable living with this stranger, although her presence elicits fragments of memories that he cannot fully recall. When Marie is suddenly arrested under suspicion of being the Alleyway Killer, he does not know what to think. Did she contrive to cross paths with him and purposely enter his life because she was seeking revenge on someone who caused her to die with regrets nearly three hundred years ago?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nIncluded one-shot: Futago Kakumei",

Idolized for his athletic and intellectual competence, looks and wealth, Naoto lived like a king during his elementary school days—then entered Mikoto Kujou, a plain, gloomy-looking transfer student.\n\nDue to her low financial status, Naoto was initially apathetic towards Mikoto. But despite having just arrived at his school, she completely eclipsed him in everything by consistently scoring top marks in exams and placing first in athletic events. After a brief confrontation with her that left him shocked, Naoto vowed to outdo her no matter the cost.\n\nTen years later, they are now students attending the same college. Having failed to defeat Mikoto throughout middle and high school, Naoto decides they will have one last game: if he can make Mikoto fall in love with him and then break her heart, it will be his victory. However, he finds himself falling in love with her instead...\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Kimi to, Shiawase., Hidamari no Niwa\nVolume 2: Wasureyuki\nVolume 4: Ninkoi",

She works part-time at a nursery school where the cute two-year-old twins Akane and Aoi Matsunaga attend. One day, a handsome young man named Seiji Matsunaga comes rushing to pick up the twins, but they refuse to go home with him, clinging onto Shiharu instead. Shocked by the children's strong attachment to Shiharu, Seiji urgently requests for her to babysit them, offering to pay twice the amount she currently earns at the daycare. Shiharu realizes the cash will cover her living and schooling expenses while also providing the experience she needs to fulfill her dream.\n\nLove So Life follows the happy days of Shiharu as she finds herself falling in love with her makeshift family, and the twins as they live out their early childhood playing, learning, and growing.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unexpectedly, she discovers that her next-door neighbor is Shuusei Kugayama, the \"prince\" in her high school who turns down anyone who confesses to him—including her best friend, Moe Shibuya. Aoi angrily confronts Shuusei for rejecting Moe; things quickly get heated, with Shuusei calling Aoi an eyesore, leaving her disappointed in the so-called \"prince.\"\n\nTo make things worse, Aoi's clumsiness renders Shuusei’s apartment unlivable and the two have to live together in Aoi's apartment as a temporary solution. However, Aoi gets to know Shuusei better while living under the same roof and begins to realize that he is not the cold-hearted, despicable person she initially thought.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis":"Teru Kurebayashi is left all alone in the world after the death of her brother, Souichirou. Well, all alone except for \"Daisy,\" someone that she can always talk to and who never hesitates to cheer her up. However, Teru has never met Daisy, she has no idea what he looks like, and her only means of contacting him is through a cell phone that her brother left for her.\n\nIn stark contrast to the kind words and encouragement Teru receives from Daisy, she gets nothing but grief from the rude school janitor, Tasuku Kurosaki, who forced Teru to work for him after she accidentally broke a window. But while Kurosaki seems like a lazy good-for-nothing who only enjoys making her miserable, is there more to him than meets the eye?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 16: Hetakuso Cupid (The Hopeless Cupid)",

Their mission: to destroy the ominous evils that lurk in the darkness known as \"Akuma.\" Led by the Milenium Earl, Akuma seek to destroy fragments of \"Innocence,\" the only weapons capable of harming the Earl and his army and bring about the Great Flood from a hundred years ago. \n\nTo prevent this tragedy from happening, the Black Order was formed as an organization dedicated to fighting the Earl. They recruit Exorcists, those with the inherent ability to accomodate Innocence, to fight against the Akuma.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Allen Walker—a white-haired boy armed with Innocence that takes the form of his entire left arm and a cursed eye that can see Akuma—is sent to the Black Order. There, Allen meets various comrades from the Order—the mercurial Yuu Kanda, the kindhearted Lenalee Lee, and the cheerful yet mysterious Lavi. Despite their different personalities, they have one goal in mind: to bring salvation to the souls of Akuma and prevent the Earl from destroying the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, when his first act of delinquency misfires, he finds himself coerced into the Game Development Club. There, he meets four eccentric girls: tyrannical student council president Chitose Karasuyama, listless club advisor Minami Oosawa, bubbly first-year Sakura Mizukami, and the petite club president and not-so-secret school terror Roka Shibasaki—all of whom are fully intent of keeping him there lest their club be disbanded due to lack of members.\n\nThough Kenji would love nothing more than to escape, his attempts to do so not only further entangle him in the club’s affairs but with their enemies as well, who are just as peculiar as his clubmates, if not more so. Yet as the club's shenanigans continue, Kenji seems to be unaware of one thing: he may actually be enjoying himself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Inside the notebook, he finds a chilling message: those whose names are written in it shall die. Its nonsensical nature amuses Light; but when he tests its power by writing the name of a criminal in it, they suddenly meet their demise. \n\nRealizing the Death Note's vast potential, Light commences a series of nefarious murders under the pseudonym \"Kira,\" vowing to cleanse the world of corrupt individuals and create a perfect society where crime ceases to exist. However, the police quickly catch on, and they enlist the help of L—a mastermind detective—to uncover the culprit.\n\nDeath Note tells the thrilling tale of Light and L as they clash in a great battle-of-minds, one that will determine the future of the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It seems her father's company is having difficulty, so in order to save it, he set up an arranged marriage between Nao and the son of a wealthy man. Nao isn't exactly happy to hear this news. To make things even more fun, Nao is attending a new high school. Up to this point, she had only attended all-girls schools. Her new school was an all-boys school up to this year, so it is about 95% guys! Nao knows that her new fiance is a student there, but she hasn't been told exactly WHO it is! Right away Nao meets two interesting guys at school. They are the somewhat surly Sakaki Mitsuru, and the very pretty boy Toono Minori. Nao actually thought Minori was a girl at first, and was rather shocked to discover he is a guy. Nao is trying to figure out which guy at the school is her fiance, but she doesn't have much to go on, only 5 hints: 1.) One of his initials is \"M\" 2.) He has a mole somewhere near his hip 3.) He has a flower-shaped birthmark 4.) She met him when she was a child 5.) Fear of high places.\n\nThe hunt is on as Nao cheerfully searches for her new fiance. More than one boy seems to fit her clues, how will she ever figure out who it is?\n",

After yet another rejection, Riiko becomes dejected and takes a walk through a nearby park. There, she discovers a lost phone and returns it to its owner.\n\nThe owner of the phone, Gaku Namikiri, is bizarre, to say the least. A traveling salesman, he pesters Riiko to accept one of his company's products as a reward. She tells him, sarcastically, that what she wants most of all is a boyfriend. Unfazed, he directs her to visit a website advertising \"lover figures,\" which she assumes to be dolls. Despite her skepticism about the company's integrity, the face of the \"Nightly Series 01\" model enchants Riiko, and she registers for a three-day free trial. She is shocked when a life-sized naked boy is actually delivered to her the next day!\n\nRiiko follows instructions to activate the very realistic robot with a kiss, and for the next three days, Night Tenjou is the best boyfriend she could ask for. However, Gaku reappears to inform her that she missed the deadline to cancel the free trial, and now she owes one hundred million yen. Alternatively, she can decide to keep Night and act as a beta tester so that the company can collect data in order to improve their future products. What choice does Riiko have? She is broke, and what's more, she has already begun to fall for the artificially intelligent Night...\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Due to a traumatic past, his belief in happiness has completely crumbled. Following an essay he wrote criticizing modern social relationships, he is punished by his teacher, forcing him to join the Volunteer Service Club: a club whose sole purpose is to help schoolmates with their requests. Upon reluctantly entering the clubroom, he meets Yukino Yukinoshita—an ace student of unparalleled beauty. As they try to fix their schoolmates' problems, how will Hachiman's wretched view of society influence his solutions?\n\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru.: Monologue is a comedy-drama that revolves around the nihilistic Hachiman's high school life and his time in the Volunteer Service Club.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Yaiba lives with his father, Kenjurou, in the forest. One day, while Yaiba was eating, a troop of gorillas came to attack. Yaiba and his father escaped and hid inside a box, but they didn't know that the box was full of pineapples and was going to be transported into the city. In the city, Yaiba finds out that he is a legendary warrior and has to fight the evil of a demonic looking high-school student named Takeshi.\n\nThe people that Yaiba meets along his journey to become a true samurai encourage him, train him, or inspire him to greatness, though at heart he is still a child, and his incredible skill with a sword is matched only by his kindness towards his friends. Though, he tends to leap before he looks, and his thick-headedness tends to turn potential allies into enemies, though his friends soon clobber him, and salvage the situation. This unlikely group embarks on a host of incredible adventures where they meet legendary figures from Japanese history, and finally overcome impossible odds, and put everything on the line, to save the entire planet from a threat not of this world.\n\nIt's a story of love, friendship, hard work, and never giving up.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Unfortunately for the delinquent, the eccentric Adachi enters the male washroom without hesitation and discovers his hiding spot in a flash. Going on a field trip with his classmates is the least of Shinagawa's concerns, but that is the very thing that Adachi would not give up on. By hook or crook, she insists that everyone in the class attend the trip, including the reluctant Shinagawa. To make matters worse, despite his constant rejection Adachi would keep following Shinagawa even after school has ended.\n\nHowever, after an encounter with a pair of purse snatchers, Shinagawa soon learns that Adachi has an unexpected side to her, and is soon thrust into chaotic school life filled with her inescapable antics. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Along with Yousuke, the Ayases, and friends she makes along the way, Yotsuba embarks on daily adventures, each one a step in her quest to enjoy the simple things in life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While stuffing her face at a sweets festival, Ichigo stumbles across a cake that reminds her of a pastry from her past. This intrigues Henri Lucas—the pâtissièr that made the cake. Impressed by her astute sense of taste, he implores Ichigo to enroll at St. Marie Academy, where they train the next generation of pâtissières in all aspects of creating confections.\n\nOn her first day as a transfer student, Ichigo prays for her success in front of a \"Queen of Sweets Spirits\" statue on campus. She is later placed in a group with the school's legendary \"Sweets Princes\"—three boys at the top of her class, each specializing in a different confectionary discipline. Struggling to keep up with the course material, she faces scrutiny from her classmates for being an amateur despite the praise she received from Henri. Upset that her skills pale in comparison to those of her talented team members, Ichigo vows to use her every waking hour to practice.\n\nSeeing her conviction, a Sweets Spirit named Vanilla answers her wishes and coaches Ichigo through the basics of baking amazing cakes. Vanilla aspires to become one of the Sweets Kingdom's \"Royal Pâtissières,\" but she must first prove her abilities by aiding a human. Using her magic, Vanilla helps elevate Ichigo's techniques and confections to the next level as the two work towards becoming top pâtissières.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Beautiful Dreamer",

And probably not for the better.\n\nKenji Endo is a normal convenience store manager who's just trying to get by. But when he learns that one of his old friends going by the name \"Donkey\" has suddenly committed suicide, and that a new cult led by a figure known as \"Friend\" is becoming more notorious, Kenji starts to feel that something isn't right. With a few key clues left behind by his deceased friend, Kenji realizes that this cult is much more than he ever thought it would be—not only is this mysterious organization directly targeting him and his childhood friends, but the whole world also faces a grave danger that only the friends have the key to stop.\n\nKenji's simple life of barely making ends meet is flipped upside down when he reunites with his childhood friends, and together they must figure out the truth of how their past is connected to the cult, as the turn of the century could mean the possible end of the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Going by the name Takashi Bidou, he is known as the number one host at club Overload in Shinjuku's red-light district. In his official occupation, he meets clients from all walks of life. Sometimes, these people happen to be victims of the criminals he is set to dispose of—at other times, they are one and the same.\n\nOutside both his jobs, Kotarou takes comfort in his friendship with the number two host, Toru, frequently seeking food or refuge at the other man's home. Little does he know, however, that Toru hides a secret which may soon necessitate a visit from the killer in a professional capacity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis":"Whispering the name Seiichirou Kitano is enough to send shivers down the spine of any student at Hekikuu High. His fearsome looks make even the toughest of men scream, and if his appearance isn't off-putting enough, he is also known to be extremely brutal in fights. In a single day, he took out the school's top thug and became the new guardian. Now, the entire school is at his mercy, and anyone who dares to challenge him better be ready to meet their maker... or so the stories go.\n\nThe truth is that all of the terrible rumors surrounding Seiichirou are misunderstandings, many assuming the worst about him because of his demon-like features. In reality, he is a kindhearted boy who goes out of his way to help others, but his attempts to do good deeds always get hilariously skewed and miscommunicated—which was the case when he became the new guardian. \n\nTime and time again, Seiichirou tries and fails to prove that he is not the demon that rumors make him out to be. He hopes to one day be able to have friends who look beyond his scary disposition and see him for what he truly is—an angel.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But the problem is that Majins have a different understanding about humans; they strongly believe that the Human Race is far superior to them in every sort of way, but in fact it is the other way around.\n\nHow can Luchiru survive in the Human World where he has different point of views on the strength of humans, which he strongly believes that with just a touch would make him combust and be disintegrated in an instant?!\n\n(Source: Pinoymanga Scans)",

Having only been able to communicate through secret letters, the two arrange to meet up with each other at a park in which they used to play. Nicknamed the \"Demon Princess\" of her middle school, the tomboyish Tsubasa struggles to get along with the other students in her class. In contrast, the feminine Arisa is the perfect class representative who achieves good grades and has many friends. Learning of her twin sister’s envy, Arisa proposes to Tsubasa that she attend school in her place.\n\nUpon returning from school that day, Tsubasa recounts how amazing her experience was to Arisa, who is horrified to learn that she is still jealous of her life. Telling her sister that she knows nothing about her classmates' secrets nor her own, Arisa attempts suicide in front of Tsubasa's eyes. Determined to uncover the truth behind Arisa's suffering, Tsubasa decides to go undercover to find out.\n\nNow posing as Arisa, Tsubasa witnesses her very first \"King Time\"—an event that takes place every Friday during fourth period where a wish of Arisa's classmates is randomly granted. Believing the occasion to be a strange joke, Tsubasa does not take it seriously until someone is hurt in the process. Seeing the extent to which the \"King\" will go to fulfill these requests, Tsubasa must uncover the King's identity and how all of this involves her beloved twin sister.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With his landlady providing him meals and his parents covering his rent, Kazunari finally achieves the peaceful life he longs for, as he is ready to enter his first year at high school. Or so it seems...\n\nUpon moving into the boarding house, Kazunari finds out that he has to share a room with resident masochist Shirosaki. He must also live under the same roof as Mayumi Nishikino, a drunkard with a hopeless love life, and Sayaka Watanabe, a seemingly innocent college student. Although he is surrounded by these unique characters, Kazunari still counts himself lucky to be living in the same building as Ritsu Kawai, a second-year student he has a crush on.\n\nAs Kazunari settles into the boarding house, he soon realizes that the inhabitants of Kawai Complex are bound to add a twist to the life he has been hoping to live.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, he is extremely narcissistic about his work, and when a senior curator dismisses his award-winning piece as conventional and bland, he loses his cool, leading to potentially career-ending repercussions. \n\nAfter seeing his son's immaturity, his father⁠—also a master calligrapher—sends Handa to a village in the Goto Islands as punishment. Deprived of city comforts, Handa moves into a house in the local village with the sole intention of spending his stay engrossed in calligraphy. However, the house he has moved into was previously the hideout for some rambunctious children, headed by Naru Kotoishi, who are unwilling to move out. Furthermore, the neighbors seem very interested in the calligrapher, who they see as an amusing oddity!\n\nDespite Handa having been uprooted from his comfortable lifestyle, his experiences with the village and its people will teach him things about himself, life, and calligraphy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The only one aware of them is his best friend, Mii Serizawa. In her past life, before the destruction of Pompeii, Serizawa was Loleus, Sirix's male best friend.

But his hopes of their romantic reunion are dashed by the arrival of his new neighbor, Yuuma Ujoh. Though he does not remember, Yuuma is the reincarnation of Serena, and he has fallen for Serizawa!

After finally settling the feud with his demonic father Yuujirou, Baki defends his title in the Kourakuen Underground Arena while stifling yawns brought about by the ease with which he defeats his challengers. Baki's friends and mentors also struggle with this new peaceful stasis, completing great feats of strength training with little enthusiasm.\n\nSoon, Japan is shaken by the reveal of a long-gestating science experiment that results in the successful cloning of legendary samurai Musashi Miyamoto. The famed warrior relishes in testing his strength against Baki and the other fighting icons of Tokyo, but he struggles to assimilate with the modern era. Miyamoto clings to his ancient ideals of honor and dueling to the death, a philosophy that clashes with the more tranquil present.\n\nAs the resurrected swordsman attempts to rise to the top of this unfamiliar society by cutting through Baki's friends, he finds himself on a collision course with the vengeful teenager. Baki embraces this rush of excitement and meets his new rival head-on.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Her hatred defines his childhood, leading to a deep disgust toward his own body and an adverse reaction to being called a demon.\n\nRichard grows up troubled by visions of England's former foe, Joan of Arc, who taunts that he will bring ruin to all who know him. He believes that he can attain salvation by helping his father achieve his destiny of becoming the king.

In keeping with the spirit of the manga, Toru and Hiroshi sport slicked back 50's style perms and adopted exaggerated swaggers that made them comical and yet also oddly cool. The drama also features an assortment of outlandish characters who sport even weirder fashions and hairdos. To describe the action in this drama, think Fight Club meets The Breakfast Club.\n\n(Source: wiki.d-addicts.com) ",

After finally escaping the cycle of violent temporary homes, Joe adopts a delinquent lifestyle in the streets of San'ya, a slum in Tokyo. He makes his way through the world with his fists, picking fights with anyone he pleases.\n\nDanpei Tange, a washed-up and alcoholic former boxing coach, notices Joe's animalistic combat ability and attempts to mentor the wild teenager. Despite developing an explosive relationship, the two form a close bond and rely on each other to look after the other homeless children in San'ya.\n\nUnable to abandon his destructive habits, Joe is arrested for petty crimes. In jail, he meets and fights with lifelong friends and rivals, including the boxing prodigy Tooru Rikiishi. Continuously challenging Rikiishi to fights, Joe is knocked out time after time due to his savage brawling style failing in the face of Rikiishi's controlled boxing technique. But eventually, Joe stuns his rival with a knockout blow, earning Rikiishi's respect and the promise that they will one day meet again inside the professional ring.\n\nFinding a reason to live within boxing, Joe takes life head-on with a new purpose. As he rises through Japan's amateur and professional boxing scenes, he contends with painful loss and increasing injury. Joe's passion for fighting is all-consuming, and he grapples with the idea that a life without boxing may not be one worth living.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Gondolas weave their way through the waterways of the dreamy town while nostalgic alleys await those who travel on foot.\n\nAkari Mizunashi, a young Manhome native, has recently made Neo-Venezia her new home. To pursue her dream of becoming a gondolier tour guide—or Undine—Akari joins the Aria Company, one of the most renowned water guide companies in town.

While the general of the Carthaginian army, Hamilcar, was forced to accede to a humiliating peace treaty, his son Hannibal Barca—an unemotive 6-year-old with an unmatched genius—was prophesied by the Carthaginians to be the destined conqueror of Rome.\n\nYears later, an adult Hannibal leads an army of 50,000 into Hispania—a peninsula under the protection of Rome—thereby triggering the Second Punic War. The Roman senate is dumbfounded, as their opponents' chances of success are thought to be slim; however, the young and prodigious Publius Cornelius Scipio quickly recognizes the threat posed by the gifted Carthaginian general. As a result of Hannibal's invasion, Scipio rallies a Roman army of 100,000 in preparation for a fateful confrontation. Based on ancient historic events, Ad Astra: Scipio to Hannibal follows two remarkable military commanders and a battle that could make or break their empires.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Yet, tensions still run high in the country—they are shunned by the majority of the white population and ruthlessly killed by the vicious Ku Klux Klan. Amidst this era of uncertainty, former heavyweight boxer Victor Freeman contends with prejudice while evading the law and bounty hunters looking to collect the high price on his head. Though charged with the murders of several white folk, the truth driving Victor's actions is much more horrific than any truly realize.\n\nHiding among the human race are intelligent, man-eating demons, who have assimilated themselves into positions of power and taken advantage of mankind's bigotry to fill their bellies. Having witnessed his father being brutally devoured by demons as a child, Victor vows to eradicate their kind for good. However, slaying them leaves nothing but a human corpse behind, effectively casting him as a cold-hearted killer. Regardless, with his robust arsenal and unparalleled boxing prowess, Victor soldiers on to destroy demonkind—even if doing so will turn the world against him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He can transform into a more wolf-like form, and also gain special powers and perform different attacks depending on the type or color of hair he eats. Formerly employed by the police and partnered with an officer, he now runs his own private detective agency with the help of his sadistic, cross-dressing secretary Yuuta (often mistaken for a girl), and Kei (a \"relatively\" normal teenager working part-time at the office.\n\nOgino, the officer formerly partnered with Hiroshi, also often helps out with cases. His arch-enemy is Don Valentino, an evil mastermind goat with a taste (literally) for money, and a variety of messed up but extremely devoted henchman, including gentleman samurai Laurence, who always wears a bag over his head. Most chapters are individual stories revolving around Hiroshi and his friends trying to arrest the Don, always failing miserably.",

He dropped a toy scale when it happened, and she's been hanging on to it as a good-luck charm ever since. Now Hisano's in high school. One of her teachers was murdered, and the police are investigating. A young man suddenly appears carrying the toy that scale belonged to. And perhaps... can he also see the hallucinations Hisano has always been plagued with? Everything is connected as the pattern slowly rises to the surface.\n\n(Source: Storm in Heaven)",

The majority of the test subjects, \"Black Roses,\" were used as living weapons and kept under control by their creator. One subject of the experiment was dubbed a \"defective failure\" and hidden away.\n\nClaudia the \"Rose Witch,\" also called a \"Crimson Rose,\" normally does not need to feed on humans and only does so if she loses her self-control. When the Roses' creator disappeared five years ago, the organization conducting research swiftly rebranded as \"Red Rose.\" Brought out of the shadows, Claudia became Red Roses' primary means to eliminate the suddenly untamable Black Roses.\n\nGuarded by the \"Thorn,\" Wilhelm, who shares a blood covenant with her—and working with a special division of Red Rose named \"Crimson-Shell\"—Claudia must survive betrayal by a suspected traitor within the organization, as well as discover the truth behind a \"Jet Rose\" who may be leading the Black Roses.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Other semi-autobiographical stories by the author had appeared in Ribon and Ribon Original in 1984 and 1985, and were included in the first \"Chibi Maruko-chan\" tankōbon in 1987. The author first began writing and submitting strips in her final year of senior high school, although Shueisha (the publisher of Ribon and Ribon Original) did not decide to run them until over a year later. The author's intent was to write \"essays in manga form.\" Many stories are inspired by incidents from the author's own life, and some characters are based on her family and friends. The nostalgic, honest and thoughtful tone of the strip led to its becoming popular among a wider audience.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Doraemon has a hard task ahead of him but he is well prepared with a huge arsenal of the most inventive and funny gadgets available.

Instead, an ominous alien mothership looms overhead, engulfing the city skyscape.\n\nThree years ago, they came. The arrival of the \"Invaders\" sparked the greatest war humanity had ever faced—one that threatened to end the world. The Japanese government scrambled to fight the Invaders. Weapons were mass-produced, sparking controversy and pacifist movements.\n\nThat day, everything changed. And yet, nothing has changed. Kadode Koyama and Ouran Nakagawa live their final days like they always have: going to school, playing with friends, and doing what any carefree high school girls would do.\n\nAs they grow up they come to learn what it truly means to be an adult, in a world where adults seem to be demons who only deceive and destroy. They come to learn the real threat to humanity is not the Invaders, but humanity itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Working class maid Emma and  wealthy aristocrat William Jones find themselves falling for one another despite their allotted positions in life, and it is their persistent efforts to traverse the dangerous minefields of wealth, power, and staunch tradition, that provides the gripping emotional drama of Kaoru Mori's Emma. The rigid social structures of the time and the disapproving elite, including but not limited to William's own family, seek to keep the lovestruck pair apart due to their heavy condemnation of this breach of proper conduct. But despite their best attempts to resist one another, William and Emma's relationship deepens, and their feelings for one another prove to be stronger than the harshest of judgments.\n\nFrom the author of the acclaimed series Otoyomegatari, comes this impassioned tour de force of two individuals who strive to never give up on their love. But will William and Emma's relationship fall prey to the slew of unforeseen ordeals that rise up to challenge it, or will they get their happy ending after all?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Yet despite the wide range of possibilities, alchemy is not as all-powerful as most would believe. Human transmutation is strictly forbidden, and whoever attempts it risks severe consequences. Even so, siblings Edward and Alphonse Elric decide to ignore this great taboo and bring their mother back to life. Unfortunately, not only do they fail in resurrecting her, they also pay an extremely high price for their arrogance: Edward loses his left leg and Alphonse his entire body. Furthermore, Edward also gives up his right arm in order to seal his brother's soul into a suit of armor.\n\nYears later, the young alchemists travel across the country looking for the Philosopher's Stone, in the hopes of recovering their old bodies with its power. However, their quest for the fated stone also leads them to unravel far darker secrets than they could ever imagine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although he has exceptional dribbling skills, Akatsuki is terrible at shooting the ball and scoring points. As a result, he is placed in Team F—a place for those who fail the selection—while Kiyoharu manages to enter the reserves.\n\nDespite the outcome of the tryout, the optimistic Akatsuki is not discouraged in his quest to join Kiyoharu.

This marks the beginning of an uneasy agreement between the Shogunate and Amanto, one that results in a countrywide sword ban and the disappearance of the samurai spirit.\n\nHowever, there exists one eccentric individual who wields a wooden sword and refuses to let his samurai status die. Now that his kind are no longer needed, Gintoki Sakata performs various odd jobs around town in order to make ends meet. Joined by his self-proclaimed disciple Shinpachi Shimura, the fearsome alien Kagura, and a giant dog named Sadaharu, they run the business known as Yorozuya, often getting caught up in all sorts of crazy and hilarious shenanigans.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Dandelion\nVolume 2: Shirokuro (Black and White)\nVolume 24: 13\nVolume 38: Bankara-san ga Tooru",

Touched by his action, Sakura begins to develop feelings toward him.\n\nOne fateful day in their second year of high school, Sakura finally musters up the courage to confess. Swallowing her fears, she reveals it to him in a classroom after school. However, unbeknownst to her, Nozaki is actually a praised shoujo manga artist working under the pen name of \"Sakiko Yumeno.\" His work is acclaimed for being sensitive toward girls' feelings, but Nozaki himself has no experience with love or being in a relationship.\n\nAll this results in him misunderstanding Sakura's confession as nothing but praise from a fan, and he simply hands her his autograph. One misunderstanding leads to another, and she somehow ends up working as an assistant for his manga. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun follows Sakura as she continually tries to convey her feelings to the oblivious Nozaki while helping him with his manga, as well as meeting his quirky assistants who coincidentally also attend Roman Academy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Mikan naively believes that her aloof best friend would always be by her side until Hotaru decides to depart for Tokyo to attend Alice Academy. The school is home to gifted children who possess unique abilities known as \"Alices.\" Heartbroken and feeling abandoned, Mikan runs away from home in pursuit of her friend, hoping that she too can enroll in the prestigious institution.\n\nAs Mikan gets accepted as a student at Alice Academy and reunites with her friend, she quickly learns that the academy is not all fun and games. The school itself is divided into a hierarchy system based on the strength of their Alice, behavior, and academic performance, as well as classifying each student under a specific Alice subgroup for a more personalized education. When she finds herself in the lowest rank, Mikan faces bullying from her classmates who all believe that she does not belong. Natsume Hyuuga, one of the academy's highest ranking students, is especially vitriolic towards Mikan for seemingly no reason.\n\nThe students begin to discover that the special academy has hidden secrets—many of which are a lot darker than one might think. As they unravel these mysteries, Mikan and her friends find themselves entangled in something far bigger than they could imagine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In order to maintain economic and political stability, the National Grainelier Special Education and Research Institute holds exclusive rights to grow and research seeds and also polices the use of seeds that can be ingested by humans. These seeds transform people into \"carriers,\" making them more similar to plants than humans and granting them dangerous powers.\n\nFollowing the death of his mother, Luca Anglade lives alone with his reclusive father Christophe. Both father and son illegally grow seeds, but whereas Luca sells his seeds in order to afford their living expenses, the goal of Christophe's experiments is a mystery. One night, a Grainelier security team arrives and attempts to arrest Christophe. He commands Luca to swallow a handful of seeds and then flee, but Luca is barely able to get a safe distance away before losing consciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself in the home of his childhood friend, Abel Guivarch, who informs him that two years have passed—but Luca does not appear to have aged a day since that fateful night.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With every case he unravels, Kamiyama slowly starts to uncover Morino's carefully shrouded past.\n\nAs Kamiyama's mask of normalcy steadily slips to reveal his dark tendencies, he finally allows himself to wonder—what if he were the one to take Morino's life?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The only problem is that Hikaru is not all that interested in board games. But Sai is not easily dissuaded. Pressured by Sai's unrelenting desire to pursue something he refers to as the \"Divine Move,\" Hikaru begrudgingly consents to playing the game, executing moves as dictated by Sai. But slowly, intrigued by the dedication of his peers, he begins to learn the basics of the game.\n\nAs Hikaru enters into the world of go, guided by his intangible tutor and inspired by his rival, Akira Touya, he cannot help but be drawn into the complex game as he grows determined to prove his own abilities. In a coming-of-age story centering around an ancient board game, Hikaru no Go tells the story of a boy maturing through the pursuit of his newfound passion.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The discovery propels the professor into the public eye, where he is met with accolades, acclaim, and the rights to name the planet. Deciding to let his daughter Remina serve as the namesake, the shy girl quickly finds herself thrust into an uneasy life of stardom.\n\nUnlike its human counterpart, planet Remina shows nothing but odd behavior. Its movements are unpredictable and show no clear orbital patterns. Even more mysterious, any star it nears soon disappears. The enigma heightens when Professor Ooguro's assistant claims that planet Remina has stopped moving and looked him directly in the eye. Before going mad, the assistant announces one final thing: the planet is now heading toward Earth.\n\nSoon enough, planet Remina enters the solar system, leaving a trail of emptiness and causing worldwide panic. In an instant, popular adoration transforms into hostility; the populace have declared that the Ooguros have orchestrated this disaster and must be destroyed to avert it. Now deemed Public Enemy No. 1, Remina must escape a rabid population, all while the looming threat of the hellstar approaches.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot: Okuman Bocchi",

He refuses to accept her apologies, and, to make matters worse, she discovers that he probably has a crush on their incredibly cute classmate Sumizome.\n\nShe has all these things in mind when she is summoned by Uka-no-Mitama-no-Kami, a pale fox goddess. In return for rescuing a little fox-spirit creature before school that day, the goddess offers to grant a single wish of Inari's. Without thinking, she blurts out that she wants to be Sumizome. As one might expect, this wish does not go nearly as well as Inari had hoped, and the kindly goddess breaks a goddess-rule to give Inari the ability to change herself back. Now, Inari can change her own shape at will, and using her new skill is very tempting as she keeps trying to win Tanbabashi's heart. But if Inari flaunts her ability, both she and the goddess might end up in trouble with Amaterasu!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",

In this era, Kagome quickly learns two things: demons walk amongst humans and she has unknowingly brought a dangerous object from her world—a marble-sized sphere known as the Shikon Jewel. This unusual orb brings tremendous power to any demon who has it in their possession, and Kagome is an easy target for anyone determined enough to steal it.\n\nWhile in a fight with a demon, a hasty attempt to fend it off causes Kagome to accidentally shatter the jewel, sending countless pieces of it all over feudal Japan. She soon learns the grave consequences of her actions when she must work with the half-demon Inuyasha to collect all the pieces of the jewel before they fall into the wrong hands.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although he is friendless, unloved by his family, and diagnosed with cancer, he decides to try living his best life and adopts a dog. However, while walking his dog one night, the reality of his hopeless situation settles in and he breaks into sobs in a park. But that sadness is short-lived as an encounter with an extraterrestrial object leaves him with a healthy yet mechanical body. Unsettled by the foreign body and his inability to cry anymore, Inuyashiki starts to believe he has lost his humanity.\n\nHowever, one night, he saves a homeless man from death, and the sight of the happy and grateful man moves him to tears—proving to him that he is still a human. From that moment onward, Inuyashiki resolves to put his new power to use for the purpose of saving those in need.\n\nUnfortunately, his joy doesn't last for long, for he finds that there is a new threat determined to revel in its own newfound power through horrifying means. Thus, Inuyashiki's mission turns from being a small-time neighborhood hero to a guardian against a thriving monster.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Due to his parents' dreadful death, Fon seeks to avenge them by annihilating the black market. Although he desires an uninterrupted life in school, he grows close to his roommate Jacques \"Jake\" Berne—an outgoing 22-year-old man who holds suspicions toward Fon's character.

Now burdened with the arduous task of rebuilding membership, he struggles to recruit anyone due to a lack of interest. Just as Kurata has lost nearly all hope in keeping the club alive, the feared delinquent Chika Kudou appears, claiming he will join and become the club president himself.\n\nAt first, Kurata refuses to admit such a troublesome person, aware of the dark rumors that have been circulating about Kudou. However, after discovering a more vulnerable side to Kudou and his mysterious connection to the club, Kurata rethinks his decision. The soon-to-be defunct club is saved with the help of koto prodigy Satowa Houzuki, who uses her charms to recruit Kudou's lively friends Saneyasu Adachi, Michitaka Sakai, and Kouta Mizuhara.\n\nWith sufficient numbers to retain the club's status, Houzuki declares that they will aim to become the best koto players in the nation, much to Kurata's dismay. This ragtag bunch of young musicians have a road filled with challenges and adversities ahead of them, and by overcoming their fears and differences, their aspirations may very well come true.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Criticisms of his appearance easily provoke him into fights, and as a result, he has earned himself a reputation as a surly and scary individual. Most of his classmates are unwilling to approach him, except for the tirelessly kind Aya Kurokawa and Yuu Narumi, who is Sagara's rival for Kurokawa's affections. One day, while the two boys are once again arguing over the girl they like, Sagara suddenly collapses.\n\nWhen Sagara regains consciousness, he discovers that he has transformed into a girl. In this world, to maintain an equal ratio of males to females, some boys randomly change sex through a phenomenon known as \"emergence.\" Refusing to accept his new status, Sagara becomes even more determined to behave as masculine as possible. Despite his efforts, both Kurokawa and Narumi soon learn of his secret—and this knowledge dramatically upsets the previous dynamic of their love triangle.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: S no Kaikoroku (Memoirs of a Sadist)",

Now 16 years old, Akabane has her sights set on the \"White Prince\" of her school, Takumi Shirakawa. But wherever Shirakawa goes, Haruto Kurosaki, the \"Black Devil,\" isn't far behind. Because of Kurosaki's evil glare and bad disposition, no one can even get close to Shirakawa. \n\nOne day, as Akabane is moving into the school dormitory, she witnesses Kurosaki threatening another student for accidentally spitting gum in his hair. But when Shirakawa involves himself in the conflict, Akabane fears for his safety. Deciding to take charge, she cuts off Kurosaki's ponytail in an attempt to end the argument. However, all she really ends up doing is giving Kurosaki another target to bully: her. Kurosaki's idea of punishment is unconventional, to say the least, and each time he toys with her, he leaves her heart pounding. Can Akabane break free from the Black Devil and stay true to her feelings for the White Prince? Or will she keep falling for Kurosaki's devilish charms?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It's all an act of deception; she is really the self-confessed 'queen of vanity,' and her only goal in life is winning the praise and admiration of everyone around her.\n\nWhen she enters high school, she finally meets her match: Souichirou Arima, a handsome, athletic, popular, and very intelligent young boy. Ever since he stole the top seat in the class from her, Yukino has hated him, and has been plotting on how to take back her former place as the object of all other students' admiration.\n\nWhat she wasn't expecting, however, was that Souichirou, the very boy she hated, would confess his love for her. Or that he would find out about her deception—and use it to blackmail her!\n\nTogether, they discover that they have more in common than they knew, and they slowly begin to bring out each other's inner selves.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Tora to Chameleon: Yakusoku wa Isshukan (The Tiger and the Chameleon: A Promise for One Week)\nVolume 4: Ashita Mata Mori de Aou ne (Meet Me Again Tomorrow in the Forest)\nVolume 8: Abareru Ousama (The Raging King)",

Yet, although she possesses incredible acting abilities, Kasane looks nothing like her mother. In fact, her visage leads many people to wonder if the two are even related. Due to her appearance, Kasane is bullied and ostracized by her peers at school. This makes her dream seemingly impossible to achieve, where good looks are assets in the acting industry.\n\nHowever, Kasane's life takes a turn for the better when she remembers her mother's words—to wear her lipstick and kiss whoever she desires. Much to Kasane's astonishment, the first person she kisses while wearing the lipstick causes her to temporarily switch faces with them. Now given a chance to pursue her ambitions, to what lengths will Kasane use this newfound power?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Her real identity is Maron Kusakabe, a 16-year-old rhythmic gymnastics enthusiast and student at Momokuri Academy— something unknown to all, even her best friend Miyako Toudaiji, who is in charge of the police chase for Jeanne.\n\nHidden inside the paintings Maron steals are demons sent by the demon lord, who plans to weaken God's power by having his minions possess human hearts. Assisted by the minor angel Finn Fish, it is up to Maron as the reincarnation of Jeanne d'Arc to assume her alter ego, hunt down the cursed paintings, and seal the vile demons away. However, the tough job of balancing this duty with her lonesome high school life only proves more challenging when a mysterious new phantom thief makes his appearance—Kaitou Sinbad.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

From a young age, Shizuku has been subjected to strange education from his father all for the sake of wine. From learning to gracefully decant a drink to intently remembering the smell of leather belts and pencils, the training causes him to grow resentful of everything related to wine. Discontent with his father, he leaves home to become an average sales representative for a beer company, refusing to ever touch wine again.\n\nWhen his father suddenly passes away, Shizuku finds himself being dragged back into the world he hates so much. As part of his father's will, the one who will inherit his prized wine collection and estate will go to the person who can correctly identify the \"12 Apostles\" of wines as well as the legendary \"Drops of God.\" In order to inherit the assets, Shizuku has one year to complete the task, but he finds the proposition ridiculous when he is the only living relative of Yutaka.\n\nWhat Yutaka failed to tell his son before his death was that he had adopted Issei Tomine into the family a week prior to his passing. Issei is a famous veteran wine critic competing against Shizuku to claim the estate for himself. With no formal training in wine tasting, Shizuku stands no chance against \"The Prince of Wine\" and is at risk of losing everything in this competition. Will he be able to correctly identify the elusive \"Drops of God\" before he runs out of time?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When these are left behind, they stain the environment, ultimately creating \"negative points\"—places that interfere with a soul's plan, causing a vicious cycle of misfortune.\n\nThe righteous Sakurai and apathetic Amano are a pair of specialists tasked with ensuring that souls follow their natural paths. To that end, as part of Psycholith Collection & Cleaning, they collect and dispose of shattered psycholiths and clean up stains. But there is another side to their job, one with moral ambiguity. They must also prevent psycholiths from shattering—even if that entails killing the soul's host.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Ever since her parents abandoned her at a young age, it has been the center of her hardship, driving her to the point of selling herself to the slave market, just to secure a place she can call home.\n\nPresented to the bidders as a rare ''Sleigh Beggy''—beings who have an unusually high affinity to magical energies—Chise's last remaining hope appears in the form of Elias Ainsworth, a mysterious magus more beast than man. Rather than keep her as a slave, he has decided to make her his apprentice, as well as his bride.\n\nChise is not only physically transported to the English countryside where Elias lives, but also introduced to a world where wondrous things such as fairies and dragons are the norm. But she soon realizes there is as much to fear in her new life as there is to marvel at. And lying at the heart of it all is the question of whether she has fallen into the hands of something much darker than her own inner demons.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

William's mindset does not allow for the existence of Heaven or Hell, so naturally he denounces Dantalion as a fraud and declines to support his candidacy for Emperor. However, the demon refuses to take no for an answer, even if he must enroll at Stratford as \"Dantalion Huber\" in order to stay near the elector and convince him.

He takes a liking to the unwilling Irie Jescar, a girl notorious for rejecting any attempt at camaraderie. But her attitude soon changes; when Shiki saves her from a Rathian attack, he reveals that he has the mark of a Forbidden Hunter—meaning he is free to hunt—and that he has only one goal: to fight the legendary Miogaruna.\n\nIrie is surprised that Shiki believes in the Miogaruna, as the only other person who believed in its existence was her late father, Gurelli. Motivated by the discovery of their shared connection, Irie and Shiki team up to fulfill Gurelli's lifelong dream.

In the end, Tenma decides to gamble his reputation by saving Johan, effectively leaving the mayor for dead.\n\nAs a consequence of his actions, hospital director Heinemann strips Tenma of his position, and Heinemann's daughter Eva breaks off their engagement. Disgraced and shunned by his colleagues, Tenma loses all hope of a successful career—that is, until the mysterious killing of Heinemann gives him another chance.\n\nNine years later, Tenma is the head of the surgical department and close to becoming the director himself. Although all seems well for him at first, he soon becomes entangled in a chain of gruesome murders that have taken place throughout Germany. The culprit is a monster—the same one that Tenma saved on that fateful day nine years ago.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although they warn her to leave the house, Himari vows to be the one to make them leave instead.\n\nBut soon, she is attacked by youkai and finds out that the house sits in the space between the world of the living and the spirit realm. Even more surprising, Aoi was chosen to be the guardian of the house—a position originally meant for Himari. But this great power came with an awful price: Aoi can never leave the mansion, and his existence in the human world has been erased. Ignoring his pleas for her to leave the mansion, Himari promises to help Aoi break the housebound curse as she begins living under the same roof as him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In accordance with this, Airi Hoshina strictly follows her routine in preparation for her dream life: to have a loving, wholesome husband and family. However, Airi's life takes a fantastical turn when a young boy appears from her hand mirror.\n\nNamed Aram Astale Ei Daemonia Eucalystia, the young prince of Astale is fleeing his kingdom to evade a magical spell. Unknowingly, his portal leads directly to Airi's hand mirror. Though he avoided the brunt of the spell, his escape did not completely save him from the magic's effects: a spell that was originally supposed to turn Aram into an old man instead ages his body to that of a 17-year-old whenever it is dark. Now, the only way to turn him back is a kiss from his beloved maiden. Busy trying to find her one true love, Airi wants nothing to do with it, but Aram insists his soulmate must be her!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With the goal of performing flawlessly at school, she aspires to eventually land a well-paying job. However, beneath her diligence for a consistent life is her passion for rock music. When her seemingly aloof classmate, Koutarou Azuma, pulls Miyako into joining his rock band, her outlook for her future begins to change. Faced with a difficult decision, Miyako needs to ask herself whether strict rules are worth neglecting for a hobby she has covertly indulged in for a long time—all while being troubled by her feelings toward Azuma.\n\nTonari no Hanako-san\nIn his final year of high school, a boy ponders about his seatmate, who seems to have passed away. Without knowing her face nor her real name, he calls her Hanako and holds onto memories of the girl he once met. At first, their encounter seemed like a chance one, but somehow her voice still lingers within his heart. \n\nSayonara Sankaku\nNoto Natsuo, Maruya Haruichi, and Nishizake Shuusuke have been friends ever since they were little kids. But one day, an unexpected confession on the school rooftop changes their childhood relationship completely. Tangled in their now complicated triangle, they attempt to work things out and understand each other. \n\nTsui Me de Otteshimaimashita.\nFor Hazuki Nakano, Youta Murakami's blonde hair stands out so much that it always catches her attention. Yet, despite being annoyed by its bright dazzling color, she cannot help but keep her eyes on him. From the outside, Murakami looks all lighthearted and flamboyant. But as she follows him more, Hazuki soon discovers another side of Murakami—which may just cause her to fall in love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Their most sought-after targets are \"The Seven Deadly Sins\": a group of criminals once regarded as the strongest of Britannia's Holy Knights. Their supposed conspiracy to overthrow the Kingdom of Liones led to their defeat at the hands of the Holy Knights, but rumors persist that the seven infamous knights still live. \n\nTen years later, the Holy Knights ironically stage a coup d'état themselves and capture the King of Liones, installing themselves as the new rulers of the kingdom. Elizabeth Liones, the third princess of the kingdom, sets out on a journey to find the Seven Deadly Sins and request their aid when she stumbles upon a bar owned by Meliodas, the Dragon's Sin of Wrath and the former leader of the disgraced knights. The pair sets out to find Meliodas' old comrades, but will it be hope or despair that awaits them in their travels?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Accustomed to making sacrifices for them, she is all too familiar with disappointment and the pain of suppressing her true feelings.\n\nThough expecting nothing to become of them, Machida becomes the basketball club manager in order to be closer to her crush. But at the start of the new school year, Shou Naruse joins the team. He is extremely talented... and has taken an interest in Machida. Stoic-faced and cold, she is unfazed by his advances, despite how relentless he is when it comes to winning her love—from kissing her with no warning to asking for permission to grope her. Keeping her cool and focusing on basketball becomes a much more difficult task when Naruse makes no effort to conceal his desires.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After joining a local band during her high school days, she falls in love with music and one of the band members. However, when faced with the choice between her relationship and her musical career, she chooses the latter and separates from her boyfriend. On her 20th birthday, she boards the same train to Tokyo, like her namesake, where she aims to become a top vocalist.\n\nThe two girls with the same name but very different aspirations find themselves sitting together on their journey to the city, and, as fate would have it, eventually share the same apartment. A deep and unique bond is then forged, where they will support each other in this saga of love, music, friendship, and heartbreak.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Now, these spirits continuously pursue Natsume in the hopes of having their contracts dissolved for freedom.\n\nWhile there may be gentle, harmless spirits which come to Natsume for help, there are also malicious, hostile spirits that threaten him. This is where Madara steps in, a spirit disguised as a rotund cat. Commonly referred to as Nyanko-sensei by Natsume, Madara is a self-proclaimed bodyguard who has his own motives for accompanying Natsume.\n\nNatsume Yuujinchou is a supernatural slice-of-life series about a boy who struggles to live a normal life while balancing the spirit and human worlds and acquiring important life lessons along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Ever since he was two years old, he has lived peacefully in his district with a bright future ahead of him. However, on the night of his 12th birthday, his perfect life changed forever.\n\nStanding in front of his room's open window, an unknown injured boy of his age strangles him. Despite being in danger, he insists on tending to the stranger's wounds instead of setting him free. The intruder, a fugitive by the name of Nezumi, reveals to Shion that the city is not as immaculate as it seems. The following day, Nezumi leaves without a trace, and the incident renders Shion and his mother void of their elite status.\n\nFour years after that fateful stormy night, the most unimaginable events transpire, causing Shion to doubt the authorities sworn to protect his home. When he is falsely held responsible for these occurrences, he once again crosses paths with Nezumi, who spares him from permanent captivity. Now, as wanted criminals, Shion and Nezumi have no choice but to explore and unveil the pretentious facade of No. 6.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This belief leads her to befriend Marin Tachibana and Aki Tezuka, two girls who exclusively talk about their boyfriends. Lacking a boyfriend, Erika is forced to make one up to fit in with her friends. She even goes so far as to take a not-so-discreet photo of a handsome young man on the street, hoping to pass him off as her boyfriend. Unfortunately, Erika's friends recognize the man in the photo as Kyouya Sata, a popular student. Realizing that she could be exposed as a liar, Erika seeks out  Kyouya and proceeds to explain the situation.\n\nAt first, Kyouya's reaction seems too good to be true, but seconds after, he orders her to act like a dog. It is at this very moment that Erika realizes she has messed up, but anything for inclusion, right? Will Erika be able to handle the weight of her lies as she tries to find a way out of this masochistic relationship, or will she see Kyouya for more than what he shows?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 2: Junketsu Lullaby\nVolume 3: Pierrot ja Nee yo\nVolume 8: Kamatte-chan de Gomenasai!!\nVolume 11: Kimi wo Suki ni Natta Riyuu (The Reason I Love You)",

Apart from adapting to a new school, Mafuyu also has to get used to living alone as the dorms are full. Therefore, she starts a new chapter in her life with limited funds, the inability to make even a cup of instant noodles, and a big dream of becoming \"an ultra-shiny female high school student.\"\n\nThis dream, however, is quite hard to fulfill since Mafuyu's sense of style is uncouth, and troubles tend to find her no matter how hard she tries to avoid them. The path to her dreams is made more difficult because of Takaomi Saeki, her unordinary homeroom teacher with barely legal teaching methods, and her delinquent classmate Kaori Hayasaka, who becomes her first new friend.\n\nOresama Teacher follows Mafuyu's adventure full of hilarious situations, ridiculous misunderstandings, and exciting action sequences, all while she still tries to become a normal feminine girl.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 29: Omae Watashi no Koto Suki daro",

Taking advantage of the chaos, vampires—who previously laid dormant underground—rise up and enslave the surviving humans, using them as livestock to harvest blood.\n\nFour years later, Yuuichirou and his family have adjusted to life under vampire control, although Yuuichirou still aspires to kill all vampires and end their reign of terror. This often puts him at odds with fellow orphan Mikaela Hyakuya, who emphasizes using wit and ingenuity to survive. Having garnered favor among high-ranking vampires, Mikaela gains inside knowledge and uses this to plan a daring escape. But during the attempt, the group of orphans is intercepted by vampire officer Ferid Bathory, who proceeds to massacre them. Yuuichirou is the only member of the group to escape to the surface, where he is discovered by the Moon Demon Company, a military unit dedicated to hunting down vampires. Given an invitation to join, Yuuichirou swiftly accepts, finally being presented an opportunity to achieve his ambitions and avenge his family.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Dreaming of leading the Lycaons to winning the championship, and in dire need of a replacement for their injured pitcher during a training camp, Kojima involves himself in a game of One Outs, only to lose to a normal fastball from the seemingly invincible Tokuchi.\n\nMesmerized by his prowess, Kojima recruits Tokuchi to the team after narrowly avoiding defeat in a rematch, believing he might just be their key to victory. However, the greedy owner of the Lycaons refuses to give him a decent salary, leading Tokuchi to suggest an unusual contract: every out he pitches will gain him five million yen, but every run he gives up will lose him fifty million yen. With his fate now tied to that of the team, Tokuchi's fight to bring the Lycaons to victory becomes yet another gamble—the very thing that he does best.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Resigning himself into living his life as someone who exudes manliness, he becomes the nationally ranked captain of his school's kendo team.

She has no interest in cooking, sewing, nor anything else that is \"girly\" in nature; however, she has a fierce kick and an equally tough attitude to match. Seeing this as the perfect opportunity to collect material for a shoujo manga he is secretly publishing, Asuka's friend, Juta Tachibana, convinces Asuka to befriend the girl. As the relationship between the two begins to blossom, so does Asuka's true nature as an \"otomen.\"\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 10: Glass no Otomen: Sen no Kamen wo Motsu Otomen\nVolume 11: Love-Tic",

Determined to turn the young men into proper heirs to the crown, Heine accepts the challenging task.\n\nWhen the princes greet Heine, their noble facade falls quickly and each of them shows their true personality: arrogant Leonhard wants nothing to do with tutors; stuck-up Bruno thinks Heine is not qualified for the job; flashy Licht only goes with the flow of his elder brothers; and stoic Kai is indifferent to the matter. However, Heine is set on educating his problematic new students—regardless of how they feel about him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The moment he arrives at the school, he meets a mysterious person who asks him to sign a contract saying he will take responsibility for his own actions. Afterward, he is confronted by the members of SEES, who place him under secret surveillance because they believe he possesses a potential far greater than any of the other members.\n\nOne night, Minato is abruptly awakened by Yukari Takeba when a Shadow comes to attack their dormitory during the Dark Hour. Feeling compelled to fight the Shadow, he picks up Yukari's gun but, instead of shooting the Shadow, he turns it on himself, awakening his \"Persona.\" Equipped with his newfound powers, Minato joins SEES to uncover the mystery behind the mysterious phenomenon.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Separated at birth until second grade, Ageha had grown up in the countryside, being raised by her grandmother, while Hana lived in the city with their parents. Due to their contrasting upbringings, the quiet and reserved Ageha constantly lives in the shadow of her outgoing and charismatic sister.\n\nDuring her childhood, Ageha befriended a boy named Ryuusei Koike and has been in love with him since. When she moved back in with her parents, the two lost contact with each other, but she was surprised to see him again in high school. Even so, she cannot bring herself to talk to him, much less confess her love for him. Seeing her woes, a mysterious man tells Ageha if she proclaims her love out loud, then Ryuusei will surely return her feelings.\n\nThinking he is delusional, Ageha humors the idea, only for Ryuusei to enter the room and remember their childhood together. Their reunion is short-lived, however, when Hana decides to swoop in and steal Ryuusei from Ageha out of jealousy. Just when she loses hope of ever being with him, the stranger from before reappears, promising to help Ageha take Ryuusei back.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Practically a political hostage, Nakaba only has one attendant by her side: Loki, whose dog-like ears mark him as an ajin—a race of beings with animalistic traits who are looked down upon by the general populace.\n\nNakaba—the possession of her conceited husband, the discarded princess of a kingdom that saw her as their shame—expects to endure her pain and continue living life no matter what. However, a splash of crimson blood dyes her world in a red hue, awakening her power—the Arcana of Time. This ability allows her to see the past—her own, which she has locked away, and that of others—and the future.\n\nBut changing the future comes at a price, and to save one life means something else must be sacrificed in return. Amidst the rising tension on the continent, Nakaba must use her power to fight not only for peace, but also to save those she has grown to love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nNote: Chapter count includes extras.",

From socializing to buying things in real life, the app has become indispensable in daily life, especially for second-year high school student Ataru Kashigawa. He uses Real Account as a means to escape reality and he feels a sense of belonging and connection to his followers, whom he considers as his friends.\n\nHowever, Ataru's views on friendship drastically change when he gets plunged into the virtual world of Real Account and is forced to participate in horrific death games alongside ten thousand other users. But these are far from ordinary online death games as dying in the world of Real Account means that you and all your followers die in reality. To make matters worse, having no followers also means certain death. As Aratu begins to participate in these death games, he discovers the existence of Yuuma Mukai, a teenager who looks just like him. This discovery creates a twist in events.\n\nBetrayed by his so-called friends one by one, Ataru is left with one anonymous follower. In this virtual world where a single follower could be the difference between life or death, Ataru must survive and complete these games in order to return to the real world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But what they find are giant mutated humanoid cockroaches with incredible physical strength. The crew members are easily wiped out, but not before sending a transmission back to Earth. Now, humanity will send elite warriors to exterminate the mutated bugs and claim back Mars.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",

            "synopsis":"Have you ever wanted your own personal Ninja? That is not a question that our heroine Beni Fujiwara has ever pondered, but she is about to find out what it is like! Many, many years ago, a ninja named Kagetora devoted his life to protecting Princess Beni (\"Beni-Hime\"). Unfortunately they are attacked, and Kagetora is flung into a lake, where he sinks to the bottom. \n\nBeni is a modern high school girl, but her life is not quite normal. The story begins with her being threatened at knife-point. Not only that, but she is standing on the edge of the roof of a skyscraper. A struggle ensues, but things go from bad to worse when a mysterious boy appears out of thin air and lands on Beni, knocking her off the edge! \n\nYou guessed it—it's Kagetora. There was a time portal in the middle of that lake, and he has slipped forward in time to modern Japan. I suppose that if you are knocked off the edge of a skyscraper, it's good to have a ninja around, because, Kagetora is able to use some of his super ninja skills to save Beni from becoming a pavement pancake. When Kagetora lays eyes on Beni, he is convinced she is his \"Beni-Hime-Sama\" and swears to be her protector. \n\n(Source: Emily's Random Shoujo Manga) ",

This title allows the current incumbent to call upon the Great Spirit and shape the world as they see fit.\n \nFinding himself late for class one night, Manta Oyamada, an ordinary middle school student, decides to take a shortcut through the local cemetery. Noticing him, a lone boy sitting on a gravestone invites Manta to stargaze with \"them.\" Realizing that \"them\" refers to the boy and his ghostly friends, Manta flees the terror. Later, the boy introduces himself as You Asakura, a Shaman-in-training, and demonstrates his powers by teaming up with the ghost of six-hundred-year-old samurai Amidamaru to save Manta from a group of thugs. You befriends Manta due to his ability to see spirits, and with the help of Amidamaru, they set out to accomplish You's goal of becoming the next Shaman King.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nNote: This entry is for the original printing of Shaman King.

He earned the title of \"Human Metronome\" for performing almost perfectly. Every musician of his age looked up to him. However, after his mother suddenly dies, he became tone-deaf due to the shock and then disappeared, never to be seen onstage since.\n\nTwo years later, Kousei lives a monotonous life with his childhood friends Tsubaki Sawabe and Ryouta Watari supporting him. He continues to cling to music, although performing is still an impossibility for him. This is until his unexpected encounter with Kaori Miyazono, a violinist who performs freely without the dictations of a score. A story of friendship, love, music, and a single lie, Kousei's life begins to change and gain color as Kaori helps him to take up music again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unseen by most, the Heart's Egg remains hidden within every individual, and represents a person's own ideal character.\n\nWhile adjusting to life at a new school, Amu Hinamori has unintentionally gained a reputation for being \"cool and spicy.\" Unhappy with her outward persona, Amu often wonders how she can act more like her true self. Her desire for change is manifested when one morning, Amu awakens to find three eggs beneath her. They hatch to reveal Ran, Miki and Suu—three \"Guardian Characters,\" each an embodiment of Amu's ideal self.\n\n\nShugo Chara! follows Amu's journey as the trio begin to show her just how much potential she has, encountering other Guardian Characters, and a few troublesome experiences along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

In the Mongol Empire's latest conquest, the Tangut people find themselves the target. With the recent defeat of Shut Hell—a notoriously vicious female Tangut warrior—the invasion is set to be quick and easy. This conquest stands apart from others however; the objective is not to simply seize the land, but to utterly destroy the Tangut culture and erase them entirely from history.\n\nIn present day Japan, Sudou is a high school slacker who is plagued by vivid dreams of ancient times. One day, he meets a sullen transfer student named Suzuki who shows an odd interest in him. However, their encounter is set to vastly alter his life. When Suzuki cries out \"Shut Hell,\" Sudou finds his world slowly fading to black.\n\nAwakening at an abandoned gallows, Sudou finds himself centuries in the past, now inhabiting Shut Hell's body. He is soon discovered by Yurul, a young boy who resembles Suzuki and possesses a complex relationship to the Mongols and Shut Hell. Realizing that \"she\" doesn't remember anything, Yurul begins to recount the tale of how they met and their current situation—one which makes them the target of the world's most ferocious empire.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The message: \"Let us meet on Mars on July 7, 2035\". With this, a space agency representing all of Earth was formed, named ST&RS. From there on, many different events occurred quite quickly, such as the re-landing of people on the moon in 2022 and the construction of many new space stations. Later on, the Space Academy was founded as a way to train upcoming generations of ST&RS.\n\nAlso on August 10 of 2019, the same day that Earth received the message from the alien life form, a young boy named Shirafune Maho uttered his first word, and the word was \"Mars.\" Ever since that moment, Maho has been obsessed with astronomy, and the only thing that he has on his mind is the universe. He decides at an early age that he will apply to the Space Academy to train to become an astronaut, along with his childhood friend, Hishihara Meguru, and a transfer student and genius classmate, Amachi Wataru. The newfound trio begins a seemingly impossible journey to get accepted into an academy where all applicants only have a 1% chance of being accepted into the Space Academy.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

While Kaoru is an honors student, Sentarou is constantly getting into fights and skipping class. However, these two opposites find a common ground in one thing—music.\n\nOne day, Kaoru is invited by Ritsuko to visit her family's record store, where he finds Sentarou in the basement showcasing his skill in jazz drumming. Kaoru, being a classical pianist, knows nothing about jazz. But inspired by the performance, he begins to open his mind to the genre alongside Sentarou. The duo begin to practice in after-school jazz sessions in the record store's basement. As he spends more time improving his skills in jazz, Kaoru finds a person whom he can truly call his friend, and comes to learn the joys of playing music.

Aided by their familiar spirits and mentor Rockin Robin, the young witches learn to adjust to human life as each aims to become the next queen.\n\nChocolat, who is popular with boys in the Magical World, finds that her strategies do not work well for capturing human hearts.

Seemingly an ordinary feline, Mahiru is taken aback when it transforms into a person! It turns out that Kuro is an outlandishly lazy and sluggish centuries-old vampire who does not drink blood and finds any kind of activity bothersome.\n\nUnbeknownst to him, the one thing Mahiru should not do is say Kuro's name aloud, but he does exactly that. It forms a bond between the two, meaning Kuro could become Mahiru's servant vampire—a \"servamp.\" But as fate would have it, after a vicious attack arranged by a vampire called Tsubaki, Kuro drinks Mahiru's blood, thus sealing the deal, making Mahiru his master—\"Eve.\"\n\nThe mysterious vampire Tsubaki reveals Kuro's real name: Sleepy Ash, the sloth and oldest sibling of seven—each representing one of the deadly sins. Tsubaki, as the forgotten eighth brother representing \"melancholy,\" wages war against all vampires and humans. To prevent bloodshed, Mahiru and Kuro now have to alert the rest of the servamps and their Eves before it is too late.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After one very romantic gesture by a popular upperclassman, she falls head over heels for who she believes to be her one true love. Unfortunately, love can be deceiving, as her feelings are soon proven to be one-sided; the upperclassman directly tells her that she's annoying and that she needs to stop bothering him. How's that for some tough love?\n\nShortly after this horrific heartbreak, her good friend Yuri suffers from a sprained wrist, making it impossible for her to continue her position as the basketball team's manager. After some coaxing on Yuri's part, Tsubasa decides to take on the role in her place. This may be the perfect opportunity for Tsubasa to move on and forget about her unrequited love.\n\nOn Tsubasa's first day as a manager, the team's shooting guard Aki Hidaka saves her from being hit by a ball. Is this another fateful encounter? Or just a random, meaningless event? One thing is for certain: Tsubasa's days will never be the same again.\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Stardust★Wink Bangai-hen: Sekai de Ichiban Semai Hoshi",

Vash does not clearly remember the destruction of July, and only wants \"love and peace,\" as he puts it; though he is a gunfighter of inhuman skill, he uses his weapons only to save lives wherever he can.\n\nAs the series progresses, more is gradually learned about Vash's mysterious history and the history of the human civilization on Gunsmoke, the desert planet the series is set on. The series is often humorous in tone, but at the same time it involves very serious character development and especially in later episodes it becomes quite emotionally intense. Vash is occasionally joined by a priest, Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who is almost as good a gunfighter as Vash himself, and later is targeted by a band of assassins known as the Gung-Ho Guns for reasons which are mysterious at first.\n\nTrigun evolves into a very serious discussion of the nature of morality, posing questions such as: What is the nature of morality? Can we judge different moral codes? If a person is forced to betray their moral code, does that betrayal invalidate that moral code, and can the person still try to live up to that moral code? Can the person find redemption from their wrongs, and if so, how?\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Trigun (pilot)",

With Kankichi's help, Souichirou begins to establish a life in Edo's tenements and exchanges his longtime sword Kunifusa for a bamboo blade, due to his newfound desire to refrain from violence.\n\nUnfortunately for Souichirou, avoiding conflict in Edo is not always possible. Before long, Souichirou finds himself stalked by the brutal assassin Shinnosuke Kikuchi, who delights in butchering anyone caught between him and his target. Each time Souichirou must step forward to defend himself or the people of the tenements, he reawakens the intense bloodlust of his younger days and resurrects memories he would much rather forget.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As his health is failing, most of the family believe he doesn't have much time left. So as a typhoon rages on outside, so too does the storm in their hearts as they squabble amongst themselves over the inheritance and the claim of being Kinzou's rightful heir.\n\nBattler, Kinzou's grandson, has returned to Rokkenjima after a six year absence, expecting the gathering to go smoothly. However, his eccentric grandfather has other plans; he enacts a bizarre game, challenging everyone to find his hidden gold. The one who finds it also receives the most coveted reward of all: the leadership of the family. However, their game is beset with violence and murder when the participants are used as \"sacrifices\" to revive the Millennial Witch of Rokkenjima, Beatrice.\n\nEver the skeptic, Battler doesn't believe in the occult. But when so many around him turn up dead, he is forced to question whether it was the work of magic or the machinations of someone among them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But Shannon has feelings for George, her master's grandson, although she is quite aware that a relationship between them would never be allowed. Try as she might, Shannon's affections for George grow stronger with each passing day, despite her attempts to deny it. One night, the Millennial Witch of Rokkenjima, Beatrice, takes pity on her: she will use her magic to help George and Shannon realize their love, if Shannon breaks a ritual mirror nearby that is dampening her powers. Eventually, Shannon relents, and to her surprise, her relationship with George begins to blossom.\n\nKanon, another servant, believes that Shannon is being tricked by the witch. As \"furniture,\" Kanon believes they have no right to even consider themselves human, let alone feel emotions like love. However, he soon discovers that one among the family has affection for him: Jessica, Kinzou's granddaughter, and eventually he starts to consider his own feelings toward her. But both Kanon and Shannon's love will be put to the test when the rest of the Ushiromiya family arrives for the annual family conference, and Beatrice enacts a competition for them to find Kinzou's hidden gold. Whoever finds the precious ingots will gain the coveted position of family head, and everyone has their eyes on the prize. But what starts off as a bizarre game soon turns into pure terror, and some of them may not make it out alive. Will the two servants be able to protect the ones they love?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Upon arriving in Versailles, the Austrian princess meets Oscar Francois de Jarjayes, Captain of the Royal Guards—a seemingly dashing young man—but to Antoinette's astonishment, he is in fact a woman!\n\nThe youngest daughter of a noble family with a prominent lack of a male heir, Oscar was raised as a boy to continue the family's military legacy. Suffocated by the rigid rules associated with her new position and longing for companionship, Antoinette immediately takes a liking to this intriguing young woman, and wastes no time befriending her. However, as the childish new queen foolishly abuses her power, Oscar is conflicted between maintaining her loyalty to the royal family and addressing the growing concern of poverty among the common people.\n\nRecalling the events of the French Revolution, Versailles no Bara depicts the struggles of two women unjustly burdened by family expectations. Yet, despite being forced to deny their identities at the expense of personal happiness, they march on to become key players in the annals of history.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis":"Unknown to her classmates, Yukina Himuro is secretly the popular cell phone novelist Yupina. What they do know, however, is her cold demeanor and icy glare—earning her the nickname \"Absolute Zero Snow Woman\"—so they tend to avoid her.\n\nBut as of late, Yukina has run into a bit of a snag with her writing: her ratings have gone down, so she wants to incorporate romance to bring them back up. And since Yukina has no experience with love, she cannot properly convey it in her writing. While seeking to change this, she runs into popular and charming student council president Shigure Kitami. During said encounter, he drops his notebook, and, to Yukina's surprise, she finds the names of the girls who have confessed to Shigure inside. She discovers that he uses his charm to manipulate girls into confessing their love for him just so he can reject them, and that his real personality is nothing like the one he shows to the world. Confronting Shigure with this information, she develops a plan: to blackmail him into teaching her about love. But when Yukina's cousin and only friend, Akira Shimotsuki, becomes jealous and confesses his love to her, Yukina may find herself with more help for these \"missions of love\" than she asked for.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Crezant immediately launches into a fantastical story: the powerful mage Animus intends to destroy the earth with his biscuit hammer, a huge contraption looming high in earth’s orbit. Earth’s only hope lies with the princess and her Beast Knights, whose task is to protect the princess and defeat Animus.\n\nYuuhi is chosen as the Lizard Beast Knight, and despite his misgivings, is quickly forced to defend himself from a golem created by the mage. He is saved by his neighbor, the princess Asahina Samidare, and swears loyalty to her. However, the princess does not intend to save the earth at all. She lets Yuuhi in on her real motivations: to prevent Animus from destroying the earth, only to then annihilate the planet by her own hand. The pair continue to fight off attacks by Animus’s golems while the remaining Beast Knights are slowly being gathered and learning to use their powers. But Yuuhi will have to decide for himself whether to go along with Asahina’s plans, whom he is getting close with, or to save the earth. In the process, he must also confront his true self, and determine where his loyalties truly lie. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He actually doesn't have a crush on his sister—in fact, he likes Hibino, the only girl in class who isn't afraid of him.\n\n The problem is that his sister is literally monster. She's a jiangshi (vampire), who is much stronger than an ordinary person and who needs a certain amount of blood from Kenji each day. Her ribbon keeps her in check, but if it comes off, she instinctively attacks the nearest person. Her ribbon also has a huge effect on her personality. With the ribbon, she's irritable and sharp-tempered, but without it, she's extremely sweet and apologetic (while she attacks). Will Kenji be able to keep his sister from hurting anyone, and maybe find some way to overcome his sister-complex reputation enough to have a chance with Hibino?\n\n (Source: MangaHelpers)",

Through these exploits, the true nature of the world is slowly pieced together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, Staz is also a lax vampire who refuses to drink human blood and bears a strange obsession with human culture, taking a keen interest in Japan.\n\nSo, when a cute human girl named Fuyumi Yanagi wanders into the midst of the Demon World, Staz develops an interest in her and uses this rare opportunity to consult her on human society. However, their conversation is cut short when a rival demon challenges his rule. Momentarily leaving Fuyumi, Staz swiftly defeats his opponent, but finds that Fuyumi was eaten by a carnivorous plant in his absence!\n\nFortunately, Fuyumi is not completely gone, as she now simply exists as a ghost in the Demon World. However, Fuyumi has lost the human appeal that mesmerized Staz in the first place. As a result of this, he becomes determined to find a spell to resurrect her body. This means traveling to the human world—a dream come true for Staz—where he, Fuyumi, and their associates' misadventurous quest is just about to begin.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

A realm separated from law and ethics, it is a testing ground to the magic users who dominate it. As a race occupying the highest rungs of their society, the magic users think of the denizens of Hole as no more than insects. Murdered, mutilated, and made experiments without a second thought, the powerless Hole dwellers litter the halls of Hole's hospital on a daily basis.\n\nPossessing free access to and from the cesspool, and with little challenge to their authority, the magic users appear indomitable to most—aside for a few. Caiman, more reptile than man, is one such individual. He hunts them on a heedless quest for answers with only a trusted pair of bayonets and his immunity to magic. Cursed by his appearance and tormented by nightmares, magic users are his only clue to restoring his life to normal. With his biggest obstacle being his stomach, his female companion Nikaidou, who runs the restaurant Hungry Bug, is his greatest ally.\n\nSet in a gritty world of hellish design, Dorohedoro manages a healthy blend of comedy and lightheartedness with death and carnage. Taking plenty of twists and turns while following the lives of Hole's residents, it weaves a unique world of unearthly origin and dreary appearance not for the squeamish or easily disturbed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

On the day of her High School Opening Ceremony, after she failed to be the top student (who usually makes the ceremony speech), she finds herself sitting next to the actual top student of the 1st years, the worst rude guy ever, Kyouta. Because of his saying bad things to her she purposely cuts his hair. Kyota requests that Tsubaki pay him back \"with her body\" but Tsubaki pays him back by fixing his hair and making it even shorter! Afterwards, Kyota unexpectedly kisses Tsubaki and swears he'll make her his woman.\n\n(Source: Shoujo Manga Maniac) ",

One day, they find themselves receiving a seemingly regular job from the police: kill a rival pimp and his prostitute. However, this job is not all that it seems, as it takes the pair down a dangerous path and triggers events that could change the very framework of Ergastulum forever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, while waiting to take the subway to school, Kei's classmate Masaru Katou leaps onto the tracks in an effort to save a drunk man. Driven by an uncharacteristic desire to rescue someone else, Kei follows Katou down into danger. While successful in saving him, the two boys are killed by the train.\n\nKei wakes up beside Katou in an apartment full of strangers and furnished by a giant black orb with a glass-like outer surface. After finding out that everyone in the room has recently died, words appear on the black ball tasking them with killing a strange creature. The ball equips Kei and the others with power suits and mysterious guns before sending them off to collect this bizarre bounty.\n\nAlthough Kei discovers the mission to be far more deadly than originally suspected, he manages to survive. He is teleported back to the apartment where he and the other survivors are rewarded point values according to their actions in battle by the black sphere, which a fellow survivor says is called \"Gantz.\" Despite his death earlier that day, Kei is granted the ability to return to his daily life with one condition: he can be uprooted from his day at any time and summoned back to the apartment, where Gantz will task him and other recently deceased with the assassination of another target. \n\nWhile Katou dreads the inevitable return to Gantz, Kei finds himself living for the sole purpose of carrying out these missions. Thriving in the heat of battle and learning to care about himself and his comrades, Kei faces escalating monstrous threats that begin to bleed out into his normal life outside of Gantz.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She asks her childhood friend, Hitoyoshi Zenkichi, for help and he grudgingly agrees, becoming the Student Council's lowest ranking member. Soon Medaka recruits two more people to the Student Council, the former judo club member Akune Kouki as secretary and the current swim club member Kikaijima Mogana, on loan for 300 yen a day, as treasurer.\n\nNow the Student Council members spend their days solving the problems submitted through the Medaka Box, whether they be hooligans in clubs where they don't belong, girls who need help writing love letters or people who've lost their pets, gradually earning the respect and admiration of the entire school.",

Ten years later, Ryouta is the sole member of the Astronomy Club, and spends late nights hoping to find proof of extraterrestrial life. One day, a girl named Neko Kuroha, who looks suspiciously like Ryouta's late friend, transfers into his class. Denying any memory of knowing Ryouta, she disappears after giving him an eerie warning. It is later revealed that Neko is a witch—a scientifically enhanced magic wielder—who escaped from being experimented upon in a secret research laboratory.\n\nSoon, other witches find their way to the Astronomy Club in an attempt to escape the tragic fate that awaits them. Witnessing the cruelty the young girls were subjected to, Ryouta takes it upon himself to protect the witches against their oppressors, and uncover the mystery behind Neko's bizarre resemblance to Kuroneko.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The mobsters corrupted the entire area, including the police by paying them off; Five Points was the mob's territory and they were the law.\n\nBut even in Five Points, where there seemed to be nothing but robbery, prostitution and murder, showed some signs of hope. Luke Burns was a honest and righteous teenager who realized that the mob was the cause of the harsh lifestyle and that joining the mobsters would not bring him the American dream. But his older brother, Brad Burns, had become the assassin to the biggest mob group of Five Points, the Grave Diggers, a secret he kept from Luke for his own protection.

He targets the few men who are said to hold comparable power to Yuujirou, including the \"Unchained\" bounty hunter Biscuit Olivia and a prehistoric human named Pickle revived from the Mesozoic era.\n\nThe demonic Yuujirou monitors his son's training with a growing anticipation.

Each convict flees to Tokyo to achieve his one goal: to suffer defeat at the hands of the world's strongest fighters.\n\nSeventeen-year-old fighting champion Baki Hanma continues to train his body beyond its limits in order to one day challenge his monstrous father, Yuujirou Hanma, to a battle. Baki grows bored with his obligatory high school studies but finds comfort and strength in his budding relationship with Kozue Matsumoto. The quiet stasis of his life is disrupted by the arrival of the death row convicts as each criminal proves his might in displays of lethal force across Tokyo.\n\nTo combat this growing threat, Baki bands together with yakuza Kaoru Hanayama, rival Retsu Kaiou, mentor Doppo Orochi, and elderly jujitsu master Gouki Shibukawa. Together the five warriors agree to seek out and defeat their criminal opponents. But Baki faces the added burden of protecting Kozue from his evil new enemies, and he must fight to prove himself worthy under the watchful eye of his father, Yuujirou.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "background":"Historie is a historical manga by Hitoshi Iwaaki that tells the life story of Eumenes, a secretary and general to Alexander the Great. Although the story is fictional, Eumenes was a real person. Historically, his past is largely a mystery, hence Iwaaki was able to take artistic liberty in his manga. The Mainichi newspaper calls Iwaaki's vision of Eumenes' past \"Bold and unique.\" Jason Thompson, one of the best-known manga critics in the United States, says that in terms of scale, ambition, and plotting, Historie is the author's masterpiece.

As a result of this, an epidemic of crime and corruption has spread throughout the country's capital city, and a state of society ensues where the privileged have absolute domination over the lesser.\n\nHowever, there exists an organization to combat this rife abuse of power: Night Raid, a secret division of the oppositionary Revolutionary Army. It is composed of a small team of ruthless assassins who murder all those who partake in or turn a blind eye to the Empire's outrageous wrongdoings. \n\nTatsumi is a naïve, sword-wielding young man on a journey to save his impoverished village. Soon, he witnesses the bloody horrors and cruelty of the capital firsthand. Overcome with hatred, Tatsumi is swayed by Night Raid's profound cause and decides to join them, embarking on a painful and dangerous mission to exact revenge on Minister Honest. Tatsumi gains many invaluable experiences as he unravels the ethics of conflicting ideologies, life and death, all while working toward the restoration of a humane world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The letter reveals a series of events that are supposed to take place that day. At first, Naho thinks it's just a prank; but when the letter mentions a transfer student named Kakeru Naruse, who really ends up transferring into her class later that day, she is forced to believe in its contents.\n\nAs Naho continues to read the letter, her future self mentions several regrets, urging Naho to take the right decisions now. Somehow these regrets all seem to be connected to Kakeru, and with the burden of the knowledge that the boy wouldn't be with her and her friends in the future, will Naho be able to make the perfect choices that will alter what seems to be fate?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nAlso includes Haru-iro Astronaut (Spring-Colored Astronaut) series.",

Within these dungeons, powerful beings called djinns rule over. When a person successfully conquers the dungeon, the djinn offers their immense strength in the form of Metal Vessels, recognizing him or her as a worthy king candidate. Adventurers from many empires and kingdoms venture into the dungeons in search of their bountiful treasures and the power of djinns. However, to travel through them is not an easy task, and only Magi—legendary magicians who choose kings and develop countries—can guide people through.\n \nAfter being trapped in a room for most of his life, a young Magi named Aladdin finally sets out on a journey to explore the world along with his friend, a djinn named Ugo, who he can summon from his flute. Through a series of fateful encounters, Aladdin meets new various friends and allies, and together they begin an adventure that will change the fate of the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When the body of Arie Kimura's mother is found by this tunnel's entrance, next to apparently human traces, the legend seems to be confirmed. Is the end of the world coming? In order to appease the wrath of the beast, the children decide to offer it a sacrifice: The unfortunate Arie, whom they believe to be the cause of the curse, is shoved into a well that leads to the Nijigahara tunnel—an act that in turns pushes Komatsuzaki, the budding thug who has carried a torch for Arie for a while already, entirely over the edge.\n\nBut this is only the beginning of the complex, challenging, obliquely told Nijigahara Holograph, which takes place in two separate timeliness and involves the suicidal Suzuki; Higure, his stalker-ish would-be girlfriend; their teacher Miss Sakaki, whose heavily bandaged face remains a mystery; and many more―brothers, sisters, parents, co-workers, teachers, aggressors and victims who are all inextricably linked to one another and all will eventually―ten years later―have to live with what they've done or suffered through.\n\n(Source: Fantagraphics)",

Even while constantly struggling in their studies, they spend their days goofing around and having romantic misadventures.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, however, Natsuki is dumped by his girlfriend. While crying alone, he receives a pack of tissues from a girl wearing a Santa Claus costume, and, in return, gives her the scarf originally meant for his ex-girlfriend. As the holidays end and Natsuki returns to school, he finds out that the girl is named Anna Kobayakawa—who luckily goes to the same school as him! Having fallen in love with Anna, Natsuki aims to get closer to her, despite his friends interfering with his plans.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Aru Toshi to Sorekara no Watashitachi\nVolume 5: Shinbun-bu no Yoriko-kun",

Within the club's room, six beautiful, bored boys spend their time entertaining equally beautiful and bored girls.\n\nHaruhi Fujioka, a poor scholarship student, has no interest in the Host Club—until she breaks a valuable vase in their clubroom. After being mistaken for a boy, Haruhi is forced by Kyouya Ootori to work for the Host Club to repay her debt. Tamaki Suou, the princely leader of the club, eagerly takes her under his wing to teach her the ways of the host.\n\nThings, however, are never quite so simple with the Host Club around. Even the most mundane events can turn into huge spectacles with the likes of prankster twins Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin, stoic Takashi Morinozuka, and sweet Mitsukuni \"Hunny\" Haninozuka. The crazy adventures of the Host Club are just beginning, and Haruhi must learn how to survive in the glitzy world of the hosts.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nNote: The final volume contains a special bonus chapter where the group travels to Spain.",

Hopelessly idealistic and romantic, Punpun begins to see his life take a subtle—though nonetheless startling—turn to the adult when he meets the new girl in his class, Aiko Tanaka. It is then that the quiet boy learns just how fickle maintaining a relationship can be, and the surmounting difficulties of transitioning from a naïve boyhood to a convoluted adulthood. When his father assaults his mother one night, Punpun realizes another thing: those whom he looked up to were not as impressive as he once thought.\n\nAs his problems increase, Punpun's once shy demeanor turns into voluntary reclusiveness. Rather than curing him of his problems and conflicting emotions, this merely intensifies them, sending him down the dark path of maturity in this grim coming-of-age saga.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The station is due to close in the coming spring, and he will retire with it. One night in his last winter manning the station, an encounter with a young girl marks the beginning of the events that will see him reflect on his working life - performing his duty as a railroad man, whilst enduring the pain of its cost to his personal life.\n\nLove Letter: Goro just got out from jail, but a police officer wants to talk to him right away. He announces to him that Goro's wife is dead and that he has to go to Chiba and take her body. Goro has no recollection of having a wife, but then he remembers he married a Chinese woman a long time ago. He married her for her money, and had she married him because she needed a Japanese visa to work. In fact, she's a prostitute who came to Japan hoping to find better life.\n\nAt first, Goro can't be bothered by this situation, but he goes to Chiba just because he can earn a lot of money. Later on, during his trip, Goro finds a letter she wrote him and through it he discovers the pure person that lies beneath this common prostitute. She is a woman of such kindness and love that Goro is moved to learn something about the woman he married. With those few words of love and tenderness, he understands her fears, her goals, and her hopes for the future -- a future that he knows will never come. \n\n(Source MU)",

Imagine Breaker can defeat any other power, but it also undermines Kamijou's own good luck. His Imagine Breaker's immense strength is literally immeasurable, so hapless Kamijou is listed at the supernatural level of 0. He happens to meet a girl in white hanging off his window balcony. The girl says she is being chased by sorcerers, and Kamijou learns that the girl is a Church of England nun whose memories have been forcibly replaced by Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum — the 103,000 forbidden texts of the Church.\n\n(Source: MU)",

But when she notices the horribly disfigured arm grafted onto her body, she soon realizes that life as she knew it before the attack is now over. Infused with the DNA of a mysterious monster known as Chimera, the arm acts on the urges of its master—leaving Aiko powerless to stop it. Alone and frightened, how will she deal with this horrible fate?\n\n(Source: CMX)",

            "synopsis":"In 16th-century Japan, Shinmen Takezou is a wild, rough young man, in both his appearance and his actions. His aggressive nature has won him the collective reproach and fear of his village, leading him and his best friend, Matahachi Honiden, to run away in search of something grander than provincial life. The pair enlist in the Toyotomi army, yearning for glory—but when the Toyotomi suffer a crushing defeat at the hands of the Tokugawa Clan at the Battle of Sekigahara, the friends barely make it out alive.\n\nAfter the two are separated, Shinmen returns home on a self-appointed mission to notify the Hon'iden family of Matahachi's survival. He instead finds himself a wanted criminal, framed for his friend's supposed murder based on his history of violence. Upon being captured, he is strung up on a tree and left to die. An itinerant monk, the distinguished Takuan Soho, takes pity on the \"devil child,\" secretly freeing Shinmen and christening him with a new name to avoid pursuit by the authorities: Musashi Miyamoto.\n\nVagabond is the fictitious retelling of the life of one of Japan's most renowned swordsmen, the \"Sword Saint\" Musashi Miyamoto—his rise from a swordsman with no desire other than to become \"Invincible Under the Heavens\" to an enlightened warrior who slowly learns of the importance of close friends, self-reflection, and life itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, Thorfinn is not part of the group for the plunder it entails—instead, for having caused his family great tragedy, the boy has vowed to kill Askeladd in a fair duel. Not yet skilled enough to defeat him, but unable to abandon his vengeance, Thorfinn spends his boyhood with the mercenary crew, honing his skills on the battlefield among the war-loving Danes, where killing is just another pleasure of life.\n\nOne day, when Askeladd receives word that Danish prince Canute has been taken hostage, he hatches an ambitious plot—one that will decide the next King of England and drastically alter the lives of Thorfinn, Canute, and himself. Set in 11th-century Europe, Vinland Saga tells a bloody epic in an era where violence, madness, and injustice are inescapable, providing a paradise for the battle-crazed and utter hell for the rest who live in it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He has no interest in getting involved with other adventurers, but circumstances leave him no choice but to find himself a party.

Tia is determined to hunt down the wizard and summoned demon that destroyed her town and family, and she intends to do this by first summoning the demon. However, demon summoning magic is forbidden, punishable by death. Tia needs to learn about the art of demon summoning, and she needs a wizard for the summoning itself. Little does she know, Zeo actually has his very own illegal summoned demon, which is why he was so insistent that he wanted to adventure alone. Will he be willing to help Tia with her quest, or will his secret lead to his execution?\n \n(Source: MU)",

However, his aspirations come to a halt when his father announces the closure of their restaurant, as he must travel abroad for cooking-related business. \n\nIn the meantime, Souma is urged by his father to attend Tootsuki Culinary Academy: a world-renowned school where expulsions of incompetent students are commonplace. Due to the curriculum's rigor, any student that manages to graduate is recognized as a chef of great caliber. Reluctantly agreeing to the proposition, Souma heads to Tootsuki's high school division for the entrance exam. Little does he know, he will soon begin a new chapter of his life—one that entails new friends, daring rivalries, and sleepless nights.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Eighty percent of the world's population wield special abilities, known as \"quirks,\" which have given many the power to make their childhood dreams of becoming a superhero a reality. Unfortunately, Izuku Midoriya was one of the few born without a quirk, suffering from discrimination because of it. Yet, he refuses to give up on his dream of becoming a hero; determined to do the impossible, Izuku sets his sights on the elite hero training academy, UA High.\n\nHowever, everything changes after a chance meeting with the number one hero and Izuku's idol, All Might. Discovering that his dream is not a dead end, the powerless boy undergoes special training, working harder than ever before. Eventually, this leads to him inheriting All Might's power, and with his newfound abilities, gets into his school of choice, beginning his grueling journey to become the successor of the best hero on the planet.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although the atmosphere in Tokyo has changed drastically due to the increased influence of the CCG, ghouls continue to pose a problem as they have begun taking caution, especially the terrorist organization Aogiri Tree, who acknowledge the CCG's growing threat to their existence.\n\nThe creation of a special team, known as the Quinx Squad, may provide the CCG with the push they need to exterminate Tokyo's unwanted residents. As humans who have undergone surgery in order to make use of the special abilities of ghouls, they participate in operations to eradicate the dangerous creatures. The leader of this group, Haise Sasaki, is a half-ghoul, half-human who has been trained by famed special class investigator, Kishou Arima. However, there's more to this young man than meets the eye, as unknown memories claw at his mind, slowly reminding him of the person he used to be.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

These life forms later became known as \"Ajin,\" or demi-humans, and were considered to be one of the greatest discoveries of mankind. The government declared their existence to be compatible with humans; however, it is rumored that they instead offer bounties for captured Ajin to secretly perform inhumane experiments on these rare beings.\n\nKei Nagai, an apathetic high school student, is studying to become a doctor and only wishes to live a normal life. However, this simple dream is shattered after he suddenly gets into a deadly traffic accident. Reviving at the scene, he is immediately labeled as an Ajin by bounty-hungry witnesses. Unable to understand his immortality or prove his innocence, he starts to live his life on the run and fights for survival. He barely escapes the government's reach when a group of anarchistic Ajin contacts Kei, asking him to join their forces to retaliate against the government. But who is Kei's real enemy, and which side will he take when it comes down to humans versus Ajin?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

At first, the manga was intended to follow the same story, but Sion Sono asked Usamaru Furuya to adapt his own story to it, which resulted in a plot much easier to understand.\n\nThe story begins with the same opening scene, where 54 girls commit suicide by jumping in front of a moving train. However, one girl survives (Saya Kota) and opens another Suicide Club, with other victims. Her best friend, Kyoko, fears for Saya's future and begins to search for the strange secrets surrounding the Suicide Club to try and save Saya and the other girls from committing such a tragedy again.",

Next came the \"Dollies\"—terrifying doll-like giants with live \"human vacuums\" and an array of other ghastly weapons at their disposal.\n\nHalf a year later, only 1% of the global population remains, and traumatized survivor Iruma Ikaruga reflects on the carnage he witnessed on that tragic day. On the verge of suicide, he inadvertently saves a girl named Yuu Banira from her would-be rapists, and the grateful Banira invites him to join the resistance group Trial and Error.\n\nIruma reluctantly agrees, and he later witnesses Trial and Error's near-impossible feat of capturing a Dolly. However, the operation falls into shambles when a more powerful and intelligent \"Pygmy Doll\" appears, killing the captive and wreaking havoc at the location. But despite the slaughter, this encounter between Iruma and Pygmy will prove vital to unraveling the elusive mystery behind the Dollies' purpose and existence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite this, he dreams of becoming the Wizard King, a title bestowed upon the strongest mage in the Clover Kingdom. Possessing the same aspiration, Asta's childhood friend and rival Yuno has been blessed with the ability to control powerful wind magic. Even with this overwhelming gap between them, hoping to somehow awaken his magical abilities and catch up to Yuno, Asta trains his body relentlessly every day.\n\nIn the Clover Kingdom, once a person turns 15 years old, it is time for them to receive their Grimoire, an item allowing its wielder to use their magic to its full capacity. At the ceremony, Yuno obtains a Grimoire with a legendary four-leaf clover, indicating the exceptional strength of its wielder, while Asta pointlessly waits for his. Feeling dejected, yet unwilling to give up, Asta sees Yuno caught by a mage who is trying to steal Yuno's special Grimoire. Despite being completely overpowered by Yuno's captor, Asta's will to keep fighting rewards him with his very own Grimoire—one with an unheard-of black five-leaf clover.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, there is something far more frightening than his ominous reputation: the fact that he is immortal. This is the handiwork of eight-hundred-year-old nun Yaobikuni, who placed bloodworms capable of healing almost any wound in Manji's body. \n\nTo atone for his crimes, Manji resolves to kill one thousand evil men. Yaobikuni agrees to this proposal, saying that if he succeeds, she will undo his curse of immortality. Soon after this promise, Manji meets Rin Asano, a 16-year-old girl who requests Manji's assistance in killing those who slaughtered her parents.\n\nInitially reluctant, Manji refuses Rin's desperate plea. However, owing to her evident lack of strength, Manji changes his mind and agrees to protect Rin for four years. With this partnership set in stone, the two embark on a perilous journey of bloodshed, vengeance, and redemption, each to fulfill their own life's cause.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nNote: Originally published with 219 chapters, which were then recollected into 207 chapters in the tankoubons.

            "background":"Mugen no Juunin won the Excellence Prize at the Japan Media Arts Festival in 1997. The series was published in English by Dark Horse Comics as Blade of the Immortal in 31 volumes from March 1, 1997 to April 1, 2015. The release featured the unusual method of cutting out and rearranging panels, which was done so to have the series read left to right while still appealing to Hiroaki Samura's request of not flipping the pages. The series was first released in monthly comics issues from June 1, 1996 to November 14, 2007 but was stopped after 131 issues. Dark Horse has been republishing the series in 3-in-1 omnibuses since January 10, 2017. The final omnibus will contain the novel Blade of the Immortal: Legend of the Sword Demon. The series has also been published in Brazilian Portuguese by Jbc in a 2-in-1 edition since December 2015.",

However, she is thrown for a loop when she sets eyes on her classmate Nekota. He has the face of a cat! No matter what angle it's viewed from, or how hard it's tugged on, his head looks like a mascot. To make matters worse, Mikki seems to be the only one who finds this strange.\n\nWith her interest piqued, Mikki unravels the mystery behind the cat-faced Nekota, and why only she sees him this way. There is no better way to get close and investigate than to befriend him. For once, the usually indifferent transfer student might just have to make some friends!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 2: Retake!\nVolume 3: Kumori Sora, Ue no Hou.\nVolume 9: Chounouryoku Shoujo Clane\nVolume 10: Hoshikuzu yori Ai wo Komete",

But after one disastrous attempt, they began relying on food from convenience stores instead. While flower-viewing, Kouhei and Tsumugi run into Kotori Iida, one of Kouhei's socially awkward students. Once she spots Tsumugi trying to take a bite out of her lunch, Kotori invites them to her mother's restaurant.\n\nIn an attempt to feed Tsumugi something delicious, Kouhei barges into the restaurant in the middle of the night—only to find Kotori waiting for them and willing to help him in the kitchen. Although Kotori is as helpless as Kouhei when it comes to cooking, the two manage to make a simple dish. It turns out that, due to her mom's job, Kotori has been eating dinner alone for a long time. For the sake of Tsumugi's happiness, Kouhei promises her and Kotori that they will all eat together—thus marking the first of many sweet moments while sharing meals.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In modern times, the Kirio family operates the Shadow Village Company, providing specialized protection services to wealthy and important individuals. Mikage has been part of a team of bodyguards for the widowed Mr. James G. Rod since she was a child. Though frowned upon, she harbors strong feelings for her master, and in turn, she reminds Mr. Rod of the family that he once had. He proposes to adopt Mikage as his daughter, so that she can quit her dangerous profession and attend school like a normal girl.\n\nHowever, the very next day after this offer was made, Mr. Rod falls victim to yet another assassination attempt. In the aftermath Mikage must decide if, and how, to fulfill her master's selfish last request.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, an eccentric young man approaches Nakoshi in search of subjects willing to partake in trepanation—the procedure of drilling a hole in the skull. \n\nThis mysterious person claims that Nakoshi is the perfect man for the experiment. Initially rejecting the offer, he doubles back on his decision after his car gets towed off. Nakoshi agrees to let Manabu Ito, a 22-year-old medical student, drill a hole in his skull in exchange for 700,000 yen. The procedure bears no results at first, with Nakoshi showing no abnormalities. This normalcy comes to an abrupt end, however, when Nakoshi begins seeing the homunculus in every person. With his perception distorted, how will Nakoshi face these homunculi?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately, all good things come to an end, and Yggdrasil's servers shut down in the year 2138. Wanting to witness the game’s final hours, Momonga, the leader of the guild Ainz Ooal Gown, logs in for the last time and heads toward the guild’s headquarters.\n\nAfter reminiscing about his comrades and adventures, Momonga prepares for the server to automatically log him out as the clock strikes midnight. However, he is not forcefully booted out of the game. Instead, he finds himself in a new world—now trapped in the body of his avatar and where non-player characters are aware of their feelings.\n\nLeft with no other options, Momonga takes on the name of his guild in hopes that other players would recognize Ainz Ooal Gown. Determined to make sense of the bizarre situation, Momonga embarks on a journey to unravel the mysteries hidden in this uncharted world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Now, he finds himself all alone in a jungle after the plane mysteriously crashed. While searching for survivors, his surroundings become increasingly suspicious as he stumbles across various animal species he has never seen before. Finally, he manages to find two survivors—his classmate Shirou Mariya and cabin attendant Kanako Oomori—being attacked by a two-meter tall bird!\n\nAfter barely managing to escape with their lives, Shirou uses his computer to pinpoint their exact location and shed some light on the strange creatures that they have encountered. What he discovers is beyond anything they expected—they have crashed on an island in the Pacific that should not exist, inhabited by animals that supposedly went extinct millions of years ago.\n\nEden no Ori tells the story of Akira and the other survivors' struggles on an island all too eager to see them disappear. With predators lurking around every corner, Akira and his friends must use all their wits to survive and unravel the mysteries of the island's origin.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Beneath it is the noxious underbelly known as The Scrapyard, where the city stockpiles all of its waste. Living amongst the vast heaps of garbage are humans and cyborgs, surviving by any means necessary.\n\nDaisuke Ido, a doctor specializing in cyborg repairs, finds the head of a young female cyborg while scavenging a pile of old android parts. Proceeding to build her a new body, he names her Gally. Upon activation, Gally does not seem to remember anything about her past life. Nonetheless, she does not seem to mind as long as she stays by Ido’s side.\n\nHowever, she soon discovers that Ido has a side job as a hunter-warrior, a bounty hunter working for The Scrapyard’s government. Despite Ido’s warning, she decides to become one herself, awakening her forgotten knowledge of fighting techniques. Equipped with newfound strength, Gally is determined to fight through the alleys of The Scrapyard and beyond, retrieving fragments from her past to rediscover her true identity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, other obstacles present themselves throughout—including the frustrated, balding vice principal, Hiroshi Uchiyamada; old enemies from his biker days; and his own idiotic teaching methods. But Eikichi fights it all whilst trying to help his students, romance fellow teacher Azusa Fuyutsuki, and earn his self-proclaimed title.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nAlso contains the gaiden \"GTO: Great Toroko Oppai♡\" (Tomoko's Big Adventures).",

She is perfectly content with her decision to commute from home, even though there is a boarding house just seven minutes away from her school. However, it also means that Ten can never spend enough time with her friends after school.\n\nTen does not mind missing out on all the fun until one day, her friend Ageha Haruna brings her to the boarding house that she has been living at. What Ten does not expect is the fluttery excitement that comes with sharing a space with one's schoolmates. As the day progresses, her resolve wavers and she finds herself second-guessing her living arrangements.\n\nJust when she is struggling with her dilemma, a couple of strange encounters with the solemn Chiaki Kasedera and the casual Riku Mikuhara ultimately lead Ten to a realization—she cannot wait to try living in the boarding house.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Afraid and alone, he created the \"Book of Vanitas,\" a cursed grimoire that would one day take his vengeance on all vampires; this is how the story goes, at least.\n\nVanitas no Karte follows Noé Archiviste, a young man who is traveling aboard an airship in 19th century Paris with one goal in mind: to find the Book of Vanitas. A sudden vampire attack leads him to meet the enigmatic Vanitas, a doctor who specializes in vampires and, much to Noé's surprise, an entirely ordinary human. The mysterious doctor has inherited both the name and the infamous text from the Vanitas of legend, using the grimoire to heal his patients. But behind his kind demeanor lies something a bit more sinister...\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After he is recognized for his abilities, Shinra joins Special Fire Force Company 8, one of many fire brigades developed to combat these Infernals.\n\nAlthough working with the Fire Force seems to have fulfilled a calling, Shinra learns that becoming a hero is not as easy as it seems. Infernal sightings are worsening across the country, and his own fellow brigadiers struggle to unite against these threats. To make matters worse, Shinra's past returns to haunt him after he confronts a mysterious cult. As he endeavors to reach the truth, Shinra soon finds himself in the middle of a conspiracy that aims to engulf the world in flames.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When her friend is supposedly swindled by a host, Hotaru feels compelled to confront the man responsible. He turns out to be her next-door-neighbor, Masamune Matsuoka, who decides that the best way to settle this is to play a \"survival game\": an imaginary war game where fake guns are used, but the battles are no less real.\n\nDespite Hotaru's best efforts, she ends up losing and incurring a large debt due to the resulting damages. Consequently, she is forced to become the third member of Masamune's male-only team \"Toy ☆ Gun Gun,\" joining his friend, Tooru Yukimura, an author of adult manga who dislikes her at first. However, before she even notices it, Hotaru becomes genuinely fond of both the sport and her team members. She chooses to share in their dream of becoming the best survival game team in Japan and winning the famous tournament, Top Combat Game, even if that means hiding her identity as a girl from her teammates.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, he accidentally finds a flyer related to exorcism and desperately contacts the exorcist Haruitsuki Abeno for help. They meet in the Mononokean—a suspicious-looking tearoom that Abeno owns—and though reluctant to exorcise the creature at first, Abeno helps Ashiya before asking for a fee. Unable to pay, Ashiya has no choice but to work for the Mononokean to pay off his debts. As time passes, the two boys learn to work together and their perspectives start to change, while secrets are revealed, one by one.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With his life motto of \"read the situation and make sure to stay away from trouble,\" he quickly finds that sitting next to Shouko has made him the enemy of everyone in his class! One day, knocked out by accident, Hitohito later wakes up to the sound of Shouko's \"meow.\" He lies that he heard nothing, causing Shouko to run away. But before she can escape, Hitohito surmises that Shouko is not able to talk to others easily—in fact, she has never been able to make a single friend. Hitohito resolves to help Shouko with her goal of making one hundred friends so that she can overcome her communication disorder.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Naruto and his peers now live in a world of peace, working hard to uphold an international truce built on good will and diplomacy.\n\nHowever, this stasis comes at a personal cost for the aging hero. Naruto and the shinobi he grew up alongside find that working to upkeep the neutral world takes them away from their families, and even the legendary warriors of Naruto's generation must contend with being mediocre parents to their bitter children, including his own son Boruto.\n\nBoruto Uzumaki faces a world completely unlike that of his father, finding unique trouble in the distance between the two. Contending with a society that heaps an unbearable load of pressure on his shoulders over his status as the Hokage's son, Boruto carves his own path through the world, fighting to make a name for himself as evil forces threaten to shatter the peace his father helped create.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She finds herself on her knees in a church, where she quickly realizes that she has become Iris Lana Armelia, the main antagonist of the otome game she played just hours before her death. Now, the final scene at the end of the game is playing out before her eyes: Edward Tom Tasmeria—the second prince of the kingdom and Iris' fiancé—publically annuls their engagement and condemns Iris over her rude remarks to Yuuri Noir, with whom Edward is in a relationship.\n\nPossessing memories of both her current life as a duke's daughter and her life in Japan, Iris knows what will happen next. After she returns home, her father tries to banish her to a church, where she will live out the rest of her days as a nun. However, Iris refuses to accept her fate, and she convinces her father to make her the acting lord of Armelia. Armed with the knowledge and skills from her previous life, Iris now sets out to bring prosperity to her land and its people.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, when he confesses his feelings soon after meeting, Mahiru knows that this is too good to be true—and something bad is sure to happen as a consequence.

In other words, she is a closet otaku and more specifically, a fujoshi. After a breakup due to these kind of interests, she quits her job and joins a new company. At her new workplace, the only colleagues who know about her secret are her childhood friend Hirotaka Nifuji, a blunt gaming otaku; Hanako Koyanagi, a cool and mature-looking beauty; and Tarou Kabakura, an attractive guy with a scary face who always gets into fights with Hanako.\n\nWhile having drinks to catch up, Hirotaka advises Narumi to date someone who would understand her hobbies. But she is hesitant—otakus are typically perceived as gross, and the only ones who can understand them are otakus themselves. Or could a relationship between two otakus work?\n\nFollowing the relationship of Narumi and Hirotaka as they begin dating, Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii is a light-hearted story about those who try to balance work, relationships, and hobbies.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Sugimoto has been left to fend for himself after his release from the army for nearly killing a superior officer. Braving the rough terrain of Hokkaido, Sugimoto is now searching for gold in order to keep a promise to his lost brother-in-arms. His efforts have been fruitless for a long time until a mysterious traveler tells him of an urban legend that would rid him of all his troubles.\n\nAccording to the legend, a criminal stole the gold of the Ainu, the indigenous people of Hokkaido, and hid it away in a location that can only be found when a map—made not from pieces of parchment, but the tattooed skins of escaped convicts—is brought together.\n\nUpon meeting with a young Ainu girl, Asirpa, Sugimoto sets off in search of the tattooed prisoners, but many dangers await as soldiers and mercenaries seek the gold as well. Aided by Asirpa's knowledge of the lands, the two of them depart to find the stolen Ainu gold in a journey of revenge, murder, and greed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When he is awakened by two unfamiliar vampires, he discovers that he is now human and that he has come back to life without any memories.

Her parents wanted her to go to school, so she was looking for a job to cover her school expenses and rent. She goes to be interviewed for a part-time house helper job but is rejected before she can say anything, because the guy offering the job is the eldest for 4 brothers and it's an all-male household. She pours out her story, so he takes pity on her and offers the job as a live-in position. However, he has one condition: she's supposed to disguise herself so his brothers don't take an interest in her. Her disguise: lots of towels around her body, so she looks fat; makeup so she looks old (39); plus her hair is all loose and she's wearing glasses.\n\n(Source: MU)",

Akiharu \"Haru\" Hayama tries to offer assurance that her art is neither hideous nor cursed; through repeated attempts, he encourages Kagawa not to be embarrassed by the things she likes. Eventually, she realizes that Hayama is someone she likes—but just how much does she like him?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Giorno Giovanna is a small-time crook with one big dream—to become a \"Gang-Star.\" No ordinary thief, Giorno has a connection to the remarkable Joestar bloodline, and possesses a Stand named Gold Experience. His dream starts to become reality when he meets Bruno Bucciarati, a mobster from the gang Passione and a fellow Stand user himself. Realizing that they share similar ideals, and both disagree with the gang's harmful affairs, Giorno reveals his goal to Bruno: with Bruno's help, he will reform Passione by overthrowing the boss.\n\nAs Giorno becomes a member of Passione, and is inducted into Bruno's squad, he discovers that it is no simple gang; its numbers are teeming with Stand users. Now confronted by other squads of differing loyalties and unpredictable caliber, their goal to change the gang from the inside out will be a tough one. Taking on these adversaries, Giorno attempts to rise through the ranks and inch closer to the boss, a man who is shrouded in mystery. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Nevertheless, what little serenity they have is stolen away when army commander Doma passes through and incinerates the village they are seeking refuge in—Agni's beloved sister included. Doma's flames do not extinguish until they have reduced their target to ash, and due to Agni's remarkable regeneration, he remains ablaze and in constant, excruciating pain.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of enduring the pain, Agni has conditioned himself to tolerate Doma's flames. However, his burning vengeance is as fierce as it was on the day Luna was taken from him. As Agni traverses a frozen wasteland, he vows to avenge his sister and kill Doma.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Her track record has been solid, but when a new threat appears online, it starts making all the headlines. A man who goes by Shinbunshi, because of the newspaper mask he wears, begins acting as a vigilante of justice. His message is simple: he can see what is wrong with society right now and although he doesn't have the power to change it, he can help the frustrated citizens release their pent up anger from the crimes that go unpunished like people treating others like trash, corrupt government pushing their weight around and other issues the typical person has no control over. Although it starts relatively harmless, it quickly snowballs out of control thanks to the power of social media and the Shinbunshi becomes an overnight internet sensation with the severity of the crimes exponentially increasing.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",

Yuu has been using this skill for years to gain the highest grades, which allowed him to enter a prestigious high school.\n\nWhen the enigmatic Nao Tomori catches Yuu using his power, she coerces him and his sister Ayumi into transferring to Hoshinoumi Academy, a school for students with supernatural abilities. The student council of the school, led by Nao, is tasked with secretly tracking down adolescents who abuse their powers. Yuu is forced to join the student council and together, they face formidable challenges that bring him closer to the shocking truth that his own, seemingly incomplete ability, might be more powerful than he could have ever imagined.\n\nAn original story from Jun Maeda, creator of Angel Beats and Clannad, Charlotte explores the supernatural lives of these teenagers and the price they must pay for being special.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But this mindset takes a drastic turn when she gets a new neighbor—Takumi himself. Unlike her, romance is just another part of his daily life; he has always been fawned over by girls. After Takumi requests Rina's aid in warding off a stalker, he kisses her, throwing her world into chaos. Rina realizes she has been envious of others and has actually been longing for the bliss that comes from romance. For the first time, she sets out to experience the feeling of loving another and being loved in return.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji Bangai-hen",

She blames her lack of experience on one person: her next-door neighbor and handsome older brother figure, Sousuke Mikami. Despite their nine-year age difference, the two are seldom apart. Sousuke helped raise Natsume since childhood, but even now remains completely overbearing. He personally wakes Natsume up every morning and takes a lower-paying job at her high school to keep a close eye on her.\n\nNatsume used to adore Sousuke, but realizes that his doting has become excessive. Having seen his true perverted nature and suffering as the object of his obsession for too long, she finally decides that enough is enough, and tries to find a boyfriend her own age. However, can she ignore the strange beating of her heart whenever she is near the person who already knows her better than anyone else?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When she fell headfirst down a flight of stairs, the resulting injury gave her amnesia, leaving her unable to recall much of her past. After being discharged from the hospital, she returns to school, where she is greeted by her friends and Hideto Hongou—her boyfriend.\n\nAlthough there are a lot of gaps in her memories, Mitsu is relieved to know that someone as reliable as Hideto is close to her. But as she begins to dig into her past, she stumbles upon a note she had written: \"As I thought, I like A.\" This confuses her, as the only people in her life with a name starting with A are her childhood friend and next-door neighbor, Akashi Kurokawa; and her chemistry teacher, Akaike.\n\nThe note causes Mitsu to question why she was in a relationship with Hideto if her past self did not have feelings for him. To make things more complicated, Hideto seems to be hiding something from Mitsu. As she continues to delve deeper into her past, Mitsu becomes fixated on demystifying the identity of A.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Nemureru Shishi ni Ai no Koe",

Her friends may think her feelings toward her brother are a bit weird, but they accept her nonetheless. Meguru's everyday life is enjoyable, save for her tension with classmate Takahi Aoyama. The two always get on each other's nerves and bicker over the smallest of things.\n\nAfter an incident on a staircase, Meguru tumbles down, accidentally locking lips with Aoyama before her vision goes black. When she awakens, she is shocked to discover that she is not only two years in the future but is also now dating Aoyama! To make matters worse, if she wants to return to her own time, Meguru will have to kiss him again!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Uchi no Shitsuji ga Taosenai",

While not as outright threatening as some of the larger nightmares out there, goblins are capable of grotesque feats of brutality in their own rights, often joining together in large bands and spreading destruction.\n\nEnter the justly titled Goblin Slayer, whose sole mission in life is to wreak havoc on goblins, murdering as many of them as he possibly can. Utilizing the realm's reigning mission system for adventurers, Goblin Slayer makes sure to accept any and all goblin-related missions.\n\nOne of these quests brings him into contact with a young Priestess, who he rescues from an assault at the hands of a particularly nasty group of goblins who have raped and slaughtered her entire party. Although initially averse to human connection, Goblin Slayer begrudgingly finds himself developing an attachment to Priestess and the other party members that they gain along the way. Often tugged into massive adventures that pull him away from his goblin-murdering comfort zone, Goblin Slayer works to keep his party safe from harm and gradually overcomes the childhood trauma that crafted him into the killing machine he has become.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Both Jirou and his grandfather are descendants of a long-standing shinobi clan, training in combat to keep the art of battle alive within their family. Jirou's life is thrown into upheaval after rescuing a seemingly normal black cat, Ragou, only to discover that the cat is actually a mononoke—a demonic spirit that has long been at war with mankind. When a hostile mononoke comes looking for Ragou, Jirou uses his shinobi training to jump to the cat's defense, but immediately suffers a mortal wound.\n\nFaced with the decision of whether or not to devour Jirou's fading energy and restore himself to full power, Ragou instead chooses to give his remaining energy to Jirou. Reviving the boy, the transfer also grants him great supernatural powers that complement his own shinobi fighting style. This act is witnessed by Ryousuke Shiba, an officer in the Bureau of Espionage whose job revolves around dispatching aggressive mononoke. Shiba extends Jirou and his grandfather an offer: to join the Bureau's new squad, Black Torch, and help them battle powerful mononoke who seek to devour innocent people.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Once the war ended, an annual tradition was proposed where a female sacrifice would be taken from the humans to be eaten by the King of Beasts. This tradition continues on as the 99th sacrifice, 15-year-old Sariphi, is taken from her village to the kingdom of Ozmargo, a miasma-filled realm where beasts live and human entry is forbidden.\n\nBut Sariphi is not like the previous sacrifices. Her optimism and lack of fear towards the beasts and her fate surprises the otherwise fearsome King.

Thousands of years later, the world is teeming with vegetation, and forests have taken the places of cities that once stood proudly. One of the very first to emerge from their stone prison is Taiju Ooki, who finds that his good friend, a brilliant young scientist named Senkuu, has been preparing for his awakening. While Taiju wishes to save the girl he loves, Senkuu is determined to figure out the cause behind the strange phenomenon and restore the world to its former glory.\n\nBut when they free the infamously powerful Tsukasa Shishiou in order to gain an upper hand against the dangers in an unfamiliar world, they realize that their new comrade has other plans. Tsukasa sees their predicament as a chance to start over; free from the corruption and destruction wrought by technology, he will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. With both sides unable to see eye to eye, Senkuu and his devotion to science will clash with Tsukasa and his primal nature in what will truly be a battle of the ages.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Akira Oomi, the object of her fantasies, is the most attractive boy in her school, and everything about him seems to be perfect.\n\nEriko's fantasies take a hit when she accidentally eavesdrops on a conversation between Akira and their homeroom teacher. His true nature is laid bare—he is, in fact, a foul-mouthed and insensitive snob. But when she clumsily forgets her phone at the scene, Akira himself approaches her to return it; however, he has already skimmed through her embarrassing Twitter posts. What Eriko does not expect is him offering to help her realize her fantasies—but only if she stays silent regarding his character.\n\nTrouble seems to follow Eriko wherever she goes, and her luck is absolutely the worst... or is it?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She is eventually forced to leave her hometown and tries to find a place for herself in the city of Tsukumoya in 1920s Japan.\n\nIn a chance encounter, Kanoko meets Souma Iwai, a gifted but penniless detective. After she is forced to demonstrate her ability, he expresses appreciation for what she can do and agrees to take her in, asking the girl to be his assistant. The Iwai investigation firm soon makes a name for itself helping clients by solving cases with Souma's sharp wits and Kanoko's power.

This is the free-for-all known as the Zodiac Royale, in which each one of the animal participants will be bound by fate to a human \"master\" on earth. Only bringing their master happiness will allow them to move up in the rankings. \n\nWhen Ichika Kotobuki, a closet fan of tokusatsu—shows with superheroes and extravagant special effects—tries to help a wounded dog, she is drawn into the Zodiac Royale as the master of the dog Komamaru. Though reluctant at first to participate, Ichika agrees on the condition of prosperity for an entire year if they win. If Komamaru wants to make Ichika happy and secure his place in the zodiac, he is going to have to be just like the tokusatsu heroes—flashy but noble nonetheless.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

From socializing to buying things in real life, the app has become indispensable in daily life, especially for second-year high school student Ataru Kashigawa.

But these are far from ordinary online death games as dying in the world of Real Account means that you and all your followers die in reality. To make matters worse, having no followers also means certain death. As Aratu begins to participate in these death games, he discovers the existence of Yuuma Mukai, a teenager who looks just like him. This discovery creates a twist in events.\n\nBetrayed by his so-called friends one by one, Ataru is left with one anonymous follower. In this virtual world where a single follower could be the difference between life or death, Ataru must survive and complete these games in order to return to the real world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Thus begins a sweet love story about a couple who have never experienced their own, and their interactions with those who support them on this unfamiliar journey.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Nakata has tried to recruit Hatohara into the club on several occasions, but failed due to the other's complete disinterest in the sport.\n\nWhile out at a driving range together, Hatohara hits a shot as straight as a laser beam using Nakata's finicky golf club, achieving a hole-in-one. This stuns his friend as well as Youzan Miura—an up-and-coming young professional golfer whose swing style has earned him the nickname \"Samurai.\" Following a brief case of mistaken identity, Miura and Hatohara find themselves playing against each other, upon which the former learns that the latter is a complete amateur who has no desire to play golf.\n\nImpressed by his opponent's innate talent, Miura requests that Hatohara reach his level and challenge him. With a newfound goal to strive for, the deadpan Hatohara sets off to secure a regular position on Eiai's golf team, in hope of teeing off against his rival again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But when a creature with the appearance of a stuffed animal steals his wallet at the arcade, Miharu's good fortune takes a turn for the worse. Lured into an abandoned storage room, he is confronted by a strangely dressed man who climbs out from the other side of an electronic screen.\n\nThe flamboyant individual, calling himself \"Romeo,\" explains that he has come from the future to partner with Miharu in the \"D-Game.\" Also from the future, the stuffed animal Edward will be the pair's Judge. Despite being unimpressed by the vague prize at stake in the competition, Miharu hates the idea of losing by default. Thus, he declares his intention to not only play the game but also become its victor. His decision proves fortunate as the fate of losers is more severe than shame—those who are defeated are sentenced to death.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After saving Tsukamoto from the bullies, Kazama invites him to a futsal match since his team is one man short.\n\nAlthough he struggles to keep up with the more experienced players, Tsukamoto is passionate and persistent; not even an injured foot stops him from running around the field. His endless runs and continuous efforts inspire the team, particularly the unmotivated Kazama. As Tsukamoto scores the winning goal, he realizes that he thoroughly enjoys soccer, as well as playing alongside Kazama.\n\nInspired by Kazama, Tsukamoto decides to join him in the school's soccer club. Little does he know, the Seiseki team is renowned nationwide, and a terrible player like him might not even pass the selection process, let alone play in the first team. Even so, Tsukamoto forces his way into Seiseki with the only thing he is good at—running straight ahead!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Months later, Miyuki is approached by creditors working for the yakuza, who inform her of her brother's disappearance and the two hundred fifty million yen loan he defaulted on. With her brother on the run, Miyuki is now responsible for his debt. The creditors give Miyuki an out: to pay off the loan with her body by working in a soapland. \n\nWracking her brain for a solution without having to resort to prostitution, Miyuki happens upon an article about the current women's tennis champion, who earned two hundred fifty million yen within the previous year. A once-promising tennis player herself, Miyuki withdraws from school in order to become a pro tennis player in hopes of paying off her debt.

Although innocent, Shiho and Makoto take responsibility for the failure to protect the money when no one else comes forward.\n\nA few days later, Yuuichi and his friends receive mysterious letters which trick each of them into meeting up. Upon arrival, they are ambushed and knocked unconscious. They wake up in a mysterious room in the presence of \"Manabu-kun,\" a character from a controversial children's show that stopped airing due to its malicious content.

Kao's older brother, an alumnus, currently a teacher and the advisor of the club, placed the responsibility on her shoulders to recruit Kuze Nagisa for the volleyball club if she wanted to quit being the manager.\n\nEven though silently observing someone as dazzling as Kiryuu in the club is the only redeeming thing about being the manger, Kao's body aches. She is at her limit and wants to quit being the manager. But no matter how much effort she puts on recruiting Kuze she simply cannot convince him to join. Then one day, she notices something that took her breath away.

After working himself to death at the age of 31, the former pharmacist wakes up as a 10-year-old child whose body has been struck by lightning. He discovers that he has been reincarnated into a medieval world as Falma, a child of the respected De Médicis family.\n\nIn a world where divine arts—magic granted through blessings from guardian deities—exist, Falma realizes that his body is host to the guardian deity of medicine. The boy has been granted the mythical divine arts of creation and reduction as well as the ability to instantly diagnose illnesses in people's bodies.\n\nHe soon discovers the terrible state of medicine in this world: only nobles are able to afford medical care, which is ineffective at best and detrimental at worst. Using modern knowledge and his divine powers, Falma gradually makes a name for himself as a pharmacist despite his young age, even earning the recognition of the imperial court. When he finally acquires a proper pharmacy of his own, he sets out to pursue his goal of improving healthcare in the San Fleuve Empire and making it accessible to all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Her parents are desperate and wish for her safe return home, afraid that she is suffering in fear and tremendous pain. However, that is not the case: in reality, she has agreed to live with her kidnapper and a previous stalker, a young man whom she lovingly calls \"Oniisan.\" She has no desire to go back to her parents—the ones who abused her physically and mentally—nor go back to school, where she endured heartless bullying.\n\nAs time goes on, their bond grows stronger, and she asks Oniisan to give her a new name: \"Sachi.\" Despite being aware of how unconventional their relationship is, the two make a promise to get married if they successfully escape both the police and Sachi's parents—or die trying. Clinging on to the littlest bit of true happiness they have found in each other, the two hold on to their only source of hope in this cruel world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, when Coco takes advantage of a golden chance to spy on the skilled witch Qifrey, she realizes that her favorite picture book was a disguised magic book all along! In her excitement, she immediately starts testing out the various spells.\n\nWhen a spell causes a disaster in her home, Qifrey rescues her just in time and decides to train her, realizing that she is the first lead he has found that could help him track down the Brimmed Caps—a dangerous group of heretics who experiment with forbidden body-altering magic and spread magical artifacts among the commoners. But before Coco and Qifrey can confront the Brimmed Caps, she is going to have to improve her magical skills and learn to get along with Qifrey's other apprentices.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As Keiichi settles in, he meets some local girls who quickly become his steadfast group of friends: Satoko Houjou, Rika Furude, Rena Ryuuguu, and Mion Sonozaki. While their life is mostly carefree and fun-filled, he begins to discover that things in Hinamizawa are not as they appear to be.\n \nDuring the annual Cotton Drifting Festival, Keiichi learns that there have been murders and disappearances for the past few years in the aftermath of the celebration. Referred to as \"Oyashiro's Curse,\" the suspicious townsfolk say that those who anger Hinamizawa's patron god will be cursed to die or disappear. At first, he believes that such things are mere folk tales meant to scare misbehaving children. But when a murder and a disappearance occur after the festival and his friends refuse to talk about the strange events in the village, Keiichi begins to wonder if his new friends may have something to do with the horrific events—and if he might be the next to die.\n \n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, her thoughts are interrupted by the arrival of Jin Haiba, the physics teacher known for being a slacker and the butt of students' jokes. Calmly, he lights a cigarette and asks for an explanation of the events that led her to this precipice. Rather than dissuade her from killing herself, he makes a request—will she enter into a romance with him before she dies? Together, the two gradually ponder why they should keep living and why they should not love each other in earnest.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Out of the gate poured soldiers and strange creatures, and they soon made Ginza look like an image of hell. The gate apparently connected Japan to another world, a world with a militant empire and many supernatural creatures. The Japanese Self-Defense Force decided to send a small group, led by a soldier who's also an otaku, into the other world on a reconnaissance mission. They're meant to learn what they can about the empire (and its plans), the world, and the people.\n\nThey're hardly in the world yet, though, when they come across a village destroyed by a giant fire-breathing dragon. The only survivor is an unconscious elven girl they find hidden in a well. Now they feel like they must warn the nearby towns about the dragon, and do what they can to help. On the way, they'll meet more magical, female companions, and learn more about this dangerous new world.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",

Little do her classmates know, she dreams of a fairy-tale romance, with a dashing prince to sweep her off her feet. While her head may be in the clouds at times, she is well aware that the likelihood of this fantasy becoming reality is next to none.\n\nJust like in a storybook, however, Hinana's prince charming does arrive; Kaede Ayase, a wildly popular actor and model, comes to her school to shoot his next big feature film. Kaede is also putting on a front for the public—while polite and considerate around most, privately he is much more laidback and has a secret butt fetish. After meeting, the two feel an instant connection, and eventually they begin seeing each other more often. Faced with media scrutiny, old flames, and past regrets, can a hopeless romantic and a somewhat perverted superstar keep their love alive?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Afraid and confused, Iruma is surprised that all Sullivan wants is to act as his grandfather.\n\nSullivan takes care of Iruma and decides to enroll him in the demon school Babyls. Iruma's greatest challenge is hiding his status as a human, so keeping a low profile among his peers is the only option. However, Iruma will soon discover that he is no ordinary human, and the demons might also be more than what meets the eye.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He is often bullied by his classmates due to his incompatibility with their behavior, the only exceptions being his two good friends who are also social outcasts. Frustrated at the way they are treated, the three wish they could stand up and claim the fun, peaceful school life of their dreams. \n\nHowever, Tousuke's life takes a drastic turn when he receives a package from his late grandfather containing their family heirloom, a scroll said to possess the power to save him from impending danger. Upon holding the scroll, a sudden glow emanates, leaving a strange mark on Tousuke's forehead.\n\nThinking that he's received the means to free himself and his friends from their daily treatment, Tousuke is shocked to find out that its effects are far different than what he had imagined. Although his bullying continues, he realizes that the mark from the scroll acts as a charm, capturing the hearts of delinquent girls—in particular, Ranna Himawari, the strongest of them all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The novel was adapted into a live-action film the following year and became one of Japan's highest grossing films, though it was condemned by the National Diet. The series was published in English by Tokyopop from May 13, 2003 to April 11, 2006. The Tokyopop version was extensively rewritten by Keith Giffen which eventually led to contradictions and plot holes in the later volumes. Tokyopop rereleased the series in 5 omnibus volumes under the name Battle Royale: Ultimate Edition from October 16, 2007 to February 10, 2009.

But when society fumbles to find the culprit behind a new series of bloody deaths, Madoka realizes that she has not just been imagining M's presence. Though his motivations are unknown, it is clear that this is the start of a twisted and ruthless culling of humanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Entering an archive, she stumbles and lands on top of a sleeping boy. Introducing himself as Risa Kisaragi, she learns that he is a mess of a student with terrible attendance rates and widely regarded as an utter slacker—the exact opposite of herself. \n\nLooking up to his personality, she begins to interact with Kisaragi to learn more about him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Her near-perfect demeanor causes her classmates to deem her difficult to approach, often comparing her to a flower blooming high atop a mountain. However, an encounter with the blissfully carefree Akira Saeki surprises yet comforts her. After all, not all people are afraid of her.\n\nWhen Ran's mother requests her to visit Soleil, a small but elegant flower shop across town, she never expects to run into Akira again. As it turns out, his family owns Soleil and he helps around the store. But this fact embarrasses him so much that he urges Ran to keep it a secret. Enraptured by their incidental meeting, Ran continues to notice Akira at school to the point where she can no longer brush off her thoughts about him. As days turn into weeks, Ran begins to wonder which warms her heart more—the exotic blossoms at Soleil, or the boy who can speak the language of flowers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Half a year later, Nozaki is miserable; she is relentlessly bullied by her classmates, who use her as an output for their pent-up rage and frustration. Though she could, Nozaki does not retaliate nor tell her parents, as she does not want to worry them. With this mentality, she is prepared to endure until graduation.\n\nBut when her bullies put her through a particularly harrowing ordeal, her parents become aware of the situation and allow Nozaki to stop attending school. However, this only instigates the bullies, forcing them to take an irreversible step which shatters her world forever. Now utterly devastated, a burning ferocity begins to swell within Nozaki, one which her bullies can only hope to escape from.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With this will, a system message announced that the Holy Sword of Vengeance activated, and time began to rewind—all the way to when he was first summoned to this other world.\n\nThis time, Kaito won't be a fool. He won't fall for their lies and platitudes. He will return every inch of pain they inflicted on him and carve it deep in their hearts so they never forget his name. They will regret using him; after all, he will not give them the satisfaction of a quick death. Even if they plead, beg, or cry, Kaito will only laugh. There is no respite from his beautiful and bloody path of revenge.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When turmoil affects his school life, he is forced to confront the divide between herbivores and carnivores, as well as his own place in this society.

As he moves into his uncle's scuba diving shop, Grand Blue, he eagerly anticipates his dream college life, filled with beautiful girls and good friends.\n\nBut things don't exactly go according to plan. Upon entering the shop, he encounters a group of rowdy, naked upperclassmen, who immediately coerce him into participating in their alcoholic activities. Though unwilling at first, Iori quickly gives in and becomes the heart and soul of the party. Unfortunately, this earns him the scorn of his cousin, Chisa Kotegawa, who walks in at precisely the wrong time. Undeterred, Iori still vows to realize his ideal college life, but will things go according to plan this time, or will his situation take yet another dive?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Ever since he was young, he had admired his world-renowned violinist father, who inspired him to pick up the instrument himself. But following his parents' bitter divorce, Aono swears to never play again and heads for high school without a direction or a prospect.\n\nDuring a physical education class, the unathletic Aono gets struck in the face with a ball and ends up in the infirmary. There, he meets the brash Ritsuko Akine who begins to play the violin in the room, believing she is alone. However, following a past incident, there have been rumors claiming that Akine is a bully, which has isolated her from her peers—a fact Aono was unaware of.\n\nAkine dreams of enrolling in a school with an orchestra, but her amateurish playing and lack of musical knowledge grates on Aono immensely. Seeing this as a perfect opportunity for the two to become friends, their teacher suggests that Aono teaches Akine how to play the violin, something Aono is vehemently against. However, as the pair spends more time together, they soon learn to understand and help each other—and Aono may finally discover the lost passion and melody in his life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Five hundred years later, the Ichinose Family split from the syndicate to establish the Order of the Imperial Moon—an organization that rivals the Hiiragi Family's reign. As the price for leaving, the Hiiragi implemented a system that aimed to oppress the next Ichinose head at a school they administer.\n\nForced to follow tradition, Guren Ichinose, a sorcerer and potential heir to the Ichinose Family, enrolls into First Shibuya High. While in enemy territory, Guren must hide his true strength at all times, even if this means that he has to endure blows from fellow classmates. Despite maintaining a low profile at school, he catches the interest of Mahiru Hiiragi—the successor of the Hiiragi Family whom he was close with long ago. With news of a chaotic event arising from the shadows, Guren yearns for power but remains ignorant about his acquaintance, who somehow shares the same sentiment.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She misinterprets his gesture and now believes them to be best friends, showing how the simplest of things can prove to be the most complicated of challenges for them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She is neither particularly pretty nor ugly, aims for the middle of her class in grades, and makes little to no waves in her interactions. She has an ordinary boyfriend to match her ordinary face, and they share countless ordinary kisses; this is what Koiko believes to be \"happiness.\"\n\nGiven Koiko's endeavors toward ordinariness, there is no reason for her to associate with Tsurugi Ninomiya. Tall, handsome, athletic, and smart, he is the antithesis of her credo. That is, until Tsurugi reveals that Koiko's boyfriend has been cheating on her, and discloses one more shocking detail: in all the time he has seen her, she has never once looked happy. With Koiko's \"ordinary\" world thrown into imbalance, is there any way for an average girl like her to find happiness?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although unable to explain why exactly she is attracted to him, Akira believes that a concrete reason is not needed to truly love someone. On a rainy day, she decides to finally tell her manager about how she feels... But just how will he react?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While countless mages have attempted to take on this gruelling objective, their results ended in either overwhelming defeat or worse. Nonetheless, Natsu Dragneel and his friends—Lucy Heartfilia, Gray Fullbuster, Erza Scarlet, and Wendy Marvell, along with the exceeds Happy and Charlés—ambitiously embark on the quest. \n\nA year after the Fairy Tail guild has overcome the diabolical forces of Acnologia and Zeref, Natsu and his team trek into the northern continent of Guiltina, where they seek out the employer of the 100 Years Quest and receive their nearly impossible mission: to seal away the Five Dragon Gods—a group of individuals with such vast power that, if left alone, could cause global devastation. Meanwhile, a spirited new member named Touka is recruited to Fairy Tail. Although her vibrant energy and passionate nature makes her perfect for the guild, there seems to be more to her than meets the eye.  \n\nDetermined to accomplish their seemingly insurmountable mission, Natsu and his friends begin their treacherous search for the Dragon Gods. However, once encountering a new dark guild named Diabolos, along with the newest recruit of Fairy Tail revealing her true colors, Natsu and his team will find that the 100 Years Quest isn't the only challenge they face.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

By infecting humans with its bite, the monster can create aggressive and undead creatures known as Kabane. On the island Hinomoto, located in the far east, people have built stations to shelter themselves from these creatures. People access the station, as well as transport wares between them, with the help of a locomotive running on steam, called Hayajiro. Ikoma, a boy who lives in the Aragane station and helps to build Hayajiro, creates his own weapon called Tsuranukizutsu in order to defeat the creatures. One day, as he waits for an opportunity to use his weapon, he meets a girl named Mumei, who is excused from the mandatory Kabane inspection. During the night, Ikoma meets Mumei again as he sees Hayajiro going out of control. The staff on the locomotive has turned into the creatures. The station, now under attack by Kabane, is the opportunity Ikoma has been looking for.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

What awaits him at the end of the path, however, is neither treasure nor riches, but a legendary dragon that wastes no time swallowing him whole! Waking up a short time later, Rentt finds himself not quite dead, but not very alive either—he is nothing more than a pile of bones! Armed with nothing but his trusty sword, tool belt, and ghoulish new looks, Rentt sets off on his quest as a newly reborn Skeleton to achieve Existential Evolution, hoping to one day return to civilization with a more human form.\n\nWill Rentt succeed, or will the labyrinth consume him for the rest of his un-death...?\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",

But in modern-day Japan, high school student and self-proclaimed ninja Rekka Hanabishi finds it difficult to carry on their legacy, that is, until he saves a cute girl named Yanagi Sakoshita from a group of delinquents.\n\nIn the aftermath of the event, Rekka deems Yanagi worthy of being his master, swearing to protect her. As a sign of their trust, the two reveal their most valuable secrets to each other: Yanagi can quickly heal wounds, while Rekka can create fire with just a snap of his fingers. However, their dazzling exchange does not go unnoticed as a mysterious woman called Kage Houshi appears. She somehow knows about their powers and threatens them, claiming Rekka must be returned, for he is the only one who can kill her.\n\nThe pair hold their ground, but before things can escalate any further, Kage Houshi calmly leaves. Thinking the crisis is over, Rekka and Yanagi continue their daily lives, unaware that they are about to be dragged into a centuries-long ninja conspiracy with the lives of their friends and their own on the line.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In exchange for their humanity they were granted immense power to defeat their foes. But though their lands were saved, some grew to fear the Incarnates in the aftermath of the war, causing them to be shunned, and some even killed.\n\nYears later in a town in the middle of nowhere, Nancy Schaal Bancroft has found her target—the man responsible for killing her Incarnate father. Armed with an elephant gun, she takes aim and fires, but he remains unharmed. Despite revealing her vengeful intentions to him, the man has other pressing matters to attend to: the murder of another Incarnate. During the clash, Schaal discovers that her father's killer is actually an Incarnate himself, and his murderous streak is due to a promise he made long ago: that any Incarnate who loses their humanity will be taken down by one of their own. \n\nAfter the beast is dead, the Incarnate known as Hank invites Schaal to accompany him on his journey, so that she can understand the truth behind her father's death and why these monstrous beings are better off dying at the hands of their former comrades.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Hoping to finally leave innocence behind, she decides to enroll in a co-ed high school.\n\nAmongst the sea of new faces, one boy draws Kanoko's attention. Reserved and aloof, Tamako Yuito's eccentric personality initially puts Kanoko off. But she soon discovers a charming and good-natured side to him: he is as inexperienced in love as she is. As Kanoko's experience comes solely from fantasies and romance shows, she now faces a different challenge when approached with real feelings for the first time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Though accustomed to being alone, her dreary days begin to change when she meets Arata Minami, a bright and handsome boy in her class. Despite his popular status, he is kind enough to reach out to an outcast like her; soon, Kuroe finds her heart begins to pound around him.\n\nIt keeps pounding and pounding and pounding until... Kuroe transforms into a monstrous kaijuu! She has a certain affliction: as her embarrassment grows, so do the monstrous appendages out of her body, and when it hits a peak, she unleashes the full extent of her transformation.\n\nAt the same time, beauty meets the kaijuu, and Japan faces off against the looming threat of the mysterious monster. Can Minami accept her feelings, or will he too be frightened off by her colossal form? Depending on his decision, the world may experience the full devastation of a girl's heart-pumping, youthful love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After finally settling the feud with his demonic father Yuujirou, Baki defends his title in the Kourakuen Underground Arena while stifling yawns brought about by the ease with which he defeats his challengers. Baki's friends and mentors also struggle with this new peaceful stasis, completing great feats of strength training with little enthusiasm.\n\nSoon, Japan is shaken by the reveal of a long-gestating science experiment that results in the successful cloning of legendary samurai Musashi Miyamoto. The famed warrior relishes in testing his strength against Baki and the other fighting icons of Tokyo, but he struggles to assimilate with the modern era. Miyamoto clings to his ancient ideals of honor and dueling to the death, a philosophy that clashes with the more tranquil present.\n\nAs the resurrected swordsman attempts to rise to the top of this unfamiliar society by cutting through Baki's friends, he finds himself on a collision course with the vengeful teenager. Baki embraces this rush of excitement and meets his new rival head-on.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, Yoshino hurries home after hearing of the news about the unification of Kansai and Kanto's biggest syndicates, the Somei and the Miyama groups. This, according to the article, will result in a marriage of the leaders' grandchildren—one of whom is Yoshino herself! Despite her best efforts to annul the arrangement, Yoshino has to go to Tokyo to visit her fiancé, Kirishima Miyama, who is unexpectedly nice and charming.\n\nDuring their first meeting, Yoshino is swept up in various events and becomes unable to refuse moving to Tokyo, which is why, half a year later, she now lives with the Miyama group. At school, she soon realizes that Kirishima is very popular, so her relationship with him garners the hate of his fangirls and subsequently results in bullying. To make matters worse, Kirishima could not be further away from her prince charming since he, after all, was born to be a yakuza member.\n\nRaise wa Tanin ga Ii follows Yoshino and her new life in Tokyo that is filled with nothing but troubles connected to the underworld. However, though she wishes to be as far from it as possible, this isn't Yoshino's first time dealing with the world of the Yakuza...\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, there is one person his age who truly cares for him—Philomena. \n\nAs children, the two quickly grow closer and forge a strong bond. However, an incident with Edi's magic, which ultimately scars Philomena for life, causes him to enroll in the magic academy. Before he leaves, the two promise their lives to each other and become engaged, thus entwining their destinies together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This is a far cry from reality, however, as Denji is forced by the yakuza into killing devils in order to pay off his crushing debts. Using his pet devil Pochita as a weapon, he is ready to do anything for a bit of cash.\n\nUnfortunately, he has outlived his usefulness and is murdered by a devil in contract with the yakuza. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Pochita merges with Denji's dead body and grants him the powers of a chainsaw devil. Now able to transform parts of his body into chainsaws, a revived Denji uses his new abilities to quickly and brutally dispatch his enemies. Catching the eye of the official devil hunters who arrive at the scene, he is offered work at the Public Safety Bureau as one of them. Now with the means to face even the toughest of enemies, Denji will stop at nothing to achieve his simple teenage dreams.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As he burrows in its folds, what sort of unseen horror is he hiding from? \n\nMokuzou no Kai (Wooden Spirit)\nMore than anything else, Megumi and her father are proud of their house's pedigree, as it has been recently honored as a national tangible cultural property. This renown draws the interest of architecture student Manami Kino, who ends up boarding alongside the father-daughter pair. As Manami becomes more ingrained in their lives, she reveals tell-tale signs of her love for the house.\n\nTomio: Akai High-neck (Tomio・Red Turtleneck)\nClad in a crimson turtleneck and clutching the sides of his head, Tomio begs for his ex-girlfriend Madoka's help. The enchanting fortune-teller who stole his heart now wants to steal another thing—Tomio's head. Lacerations wind around his neck, and the only thing keeping him whole is the waning strength of his hands.\n\nYuruyaka na Wakare (Gentle Goodbye)\nAgainst his family's wishes, Makoto Tokura marries Riko. Soon, she learns of the family's special ritual. They have the ability to bring back the ghosts of the dead, calling them \"afterimages.\" After a couple of decades, these afterimages will fade, but they grant family members the chance to say a gentle goodbye to loved ones. Riko hopes the family can bring back the afterimage of her father when he dies, but even after years, they still don't approve of her. What secret could they be hiding?\n\nKaibou-chan (Dissection-chan)\nAt Chuo Medical University, students prepare to dissect cadavers to study their anatomy. However, one group is in for a surprise when they unwrap their body bag to discover the woman inside is still alive! Ruriko Tamiya is a psychotic girl obsessed with being dissected. As a child, she would carve open small animals' stomachs while her unwilling accomplice Tatsuro Kamata would hold them down.\n\nTatsuro was able to escape her influence, but now, eight years later, she begs him to open her stomach. What horrors lurk beneath her veneer of skin?\n\nKuroi Tori (Blackbird)\nCrippled in the wilderness, Shiro Moriguchi survived for a month off the provisions in his backpack... or so he says. In truth, his survival depended on a mysterious bird-woman who fed him regurgitated raw meat. However, even Moriguchi's rescue can't save him from her far too \"caring\" tendencies, as she continues to force-feed him meat and organs of unknown origin. \n\nNanakuse Magami (Magami Nanakuse)\nMagami Nanakuse is a talented author, whose stories focus on people with strange habits called \"tics.\" Despite their obscure status, Magami's books are addicting. One such avid fan is Kaoru Koketsu. An aspiring novelist herself, Kaoru receives the chance of a lifetime when Magami invites Kaoru to visit. However, this visit doesn't turn out happy; Magami declares Kaoru a \"tic faker,\" ranting on the poor girl. After drinking together, their conversation leads Magami to see a spark of potential in Kaoru—the ultimate tic.\n\nMimikosuru Onna (Whispering Woman)\nMayumi Santo only knows how to live by taking orders. Should she sit, and if so, how should she sit? Does she lower her bottom first, or does she bend her knees first? Every one of Mayumi's actions requires strict direction for her to feel sane. Though her father Shigeki loves her, he is at wits' end as every caretaker eventually quits. His saving grace comes in the form of Mitsu Uchida, a beautiful young lady who offers to become the next caretaker. \n\nDespite Shigeki's initial misgivings, Mitsu proves to be more adept than any before her. Still, the mystery remains—just who is Mitsu Uchida, and for what reasons does she go to such lengths to care for Mayumi?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

And while doing these things his age quickly approached thirty. One day while searching the mountains for herbs, he discovered an abandoned child. Thinking that he couldn't just leave it, he took it home and raised it until his age approached forty.\n\nHis now grown-up daughter had also wanted to become an adventurer, likely from growing up watching her father. Although her father had taught her the sword since she was young for self-defense, her talent at it was quite impressive. Thinking that it would be better for her not to be stuck out in the country for the rest of her life, our protagonist sent her to the adventurers' guild in the Capital.\n\nAfter another five years, the protagonist now in his forties is still acting as a pseudo-adventurer in the countryside, however, his daughter—now a distinguished S-Class adventurer—hasn't returned home even once yet...\n\n(Source: MU, edited)",

Carelessness leads to her being robbed and having to camp in a local park. There, she is pestered daily by a high school student she had previously witnessed bullying others. The apparently wealthy Issei Kataoka seems to take pleasure from making fools of people who covet his riches. After she refuses his money, Issei offers Hayame something even more valuable given her current situation: if she plays along with his games, at the cost of her pride, then she can live under his roof free of charge.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Believing that the world lacks individuality, he wants nothing more than to be unique and remembered. The boy seemingly gets the chance to leave his name in history when he becomes the first to be diagnosed with a new incurable disease that is estimated to kill him by the age of 12.\n\nJust as he is rejoicing about his newfound individuality, he meets a cheerful, prodigious girl who has the same disease—and is nearing her 12th birthday. As the boy realizes that he won't be the first to die from the disease and therefore won't be remembered, he forms a twisted plan: kill the girl before her illness does.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Betrothed to the marquis's son Ramor Curion when she was little, she paid little heed to his rude personality, focusing rather on the potential business opportunities from his title. As she has never had an emotional attachment to him, Yulia doesn't care when he annuls their engagement to be with Julie Banache.\n\nIt turns out that Miss Banache has delusions of grandeur, believing herself to be the main character of a popular novel in which the protagonist is loved by many noblemen, including a marquis's son and the prince of the country. She has superimposed everyone in her life onto the characters—Yulia as the villainess, Ramor as the secondary male lead, and First Prince Rudonik Reino Palacio as Miss Banache's fated one—using the plot as a forteller of future events. \n\nBut fiction is only fiction, and the one behind the book's publication is Yulia herself. Never one to miss out on a profit, she has taken every opportunity to expand her businesses, and romance is just another lucrative venture!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To that end, she's gone so far as to map out her entire life ahead of time, but all of her preparation flies out the window on the first day of school.\n\nMitsumi misses her train stop and is about to be late to the entrance ceremony, which is especially troublesome because she is supposed to give a speech as the new students' representative.

Operating as Westalis' master spy, Twilight works tirelessly to prevent extremists from sparking a war with neighboring country Ostania. For his latest mission, he must investigate Ostanian politician Donovan Desmond by infiltrating his son's school: the prestigious Eden Academy. Thus, the agent faces the most difficult task of his career: get married, have a child, and play family.\n\nTwilight, or \"Loid Forger,\" quickly adopts the unassuming orphan Anya to play the role of a six-year-old daughter and prospective Eden Academy student. For a wife, he comes across Yor Briar, an absent-minded office worker who needs a pretend partner of her own to impress her friends. However, Loid is not the only one with a hidden nature. Yor moonlights as the lethal assassin \"Thorn Princess.\" For her, marrying Loid creates the perfect cover. Meanwhile, Anya is not the ordinary girl she appears to be; she is an esper, the product of secret experiments that allow her to read minds. Although she uncovers their true identities, Anya is thrilled that her new parents are cool secret agents! She would never tell them, of course. That would ruin the fun.\n\nUnder the guise of \"The Forgers,\" the spy, the assassin, and the esper must act as a family while carrying out their own agendas. Although these liars and misfits are only playing parts, they soon find that family is about far more than blood relations.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Then, after seeing a portrait of her fiancé Wolfgang Eisenhut, a surge of memories flow into her head: she is the rival character of a yandere otome game, and Wolfgang is one of the many \"target\" characters.\n\nIn the original storyline, Licorice was the jealous rival, committing terrible and violent acts, and even in the heroine's good ending, she would die a bloody death. Mustering her courage and scattered recollections, Licorice is ready to do whatever it takes to avoid such a dreadful downfall, but can she prevent Wolfgang from becoming a yandere? It is not that simple to alter the course of fate, and she may have to accept that one's nature is not so easily changed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Fortunately, it seems he's on the right path, ranking first in the nation's mock exams and set to enter his high school of choice. \n\nHowever, everything changes in a single night when he notices a girl across the street on his way home. Enraptured by her overwhelming cuteness, it's love at first sight for Nasa. But in his infatuated daze, he fails to notice the approaching danger speeding down the road and finds himself at death's door. Barely alive thanks to the girl's intervention, Nasa musters the courage to confess his love to her, fearing she might otherwise vanish from his life. She accepts his proposal on one condition: marriage, to which Nasa gladly accepts before passing out from his injuries. Upon waking, however, the girl is nowhere to be found.\n\nAfter recovering from his injuries, Nasa tosses his previous ambitions aside and dedicates his life to finding the girl that captured his heart, yet several years pass to no avail. But one night, when an unexpected visitor comes knocking on his door, Nasa finds himself facing a woman that would forever change his world: his wife.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When the third-grader arrives home one day, his father introduces him to Koharu Mori, a young wheelchair-bound girl with prosthetic limbs who from now on will be Ryuunosuke's younger sister. For Ryuunosuke, this means that he must care for her at every moment and will have no time for himself. Though sympathetic to Koharu's situation, Ryuunosuke comes to resent her and the responsibility that threatens to rob him of his youth.\n\nHowever, Ryuunosuke soon finds his mundane reality replaced by fantasy. When he finds Koharu floating in the air one night, a nightmarish creature from his imagination suddenly attacks them. After his father dispatches the monster, he reveals that Koharu is actually a divine being; her very presence can materialize the monsters that come from the innate fears of others—a power so great that it could lead to the end of the world if used in the wrong hands. With the help of Toukaishuu, an alliance dedicated to dispatching monsters, Ryuunosuke vows to protect Koharu and fight against those who intend to use her abilities for evil.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: Momo Monogatari: Toshiharu to Tomodachi-hen",

Additionally, he lives in a tight financial state as a result of family debts. \n\nFuutarou's mundane lifestyle is interrupted when Itsuki Nakano, a new transfer student, contests him for his usual lunch seat. After a short altercation, Fuutarou emerges victorious by insulting Itsuki's eating habits, which angers her enough to leave. However, when Fuutarou learns that he has been offered the private tutor position of a wealthy family's academically hopeless daughters, he immediately regrets his prior encounter. It turns out that the beneficiaries of his tutoring are none other than Itsuki and her four identical siblings: the shy Miku, the cheerful Yotsuba, the devious Nino, and the mature Ichika! \n\nTeaching these quintuplets may prove more difficult for Fuutarou than he initially expected, as the last thing they want to do is seriously study. Now, Fuutarou must face the various challenges of tutoring five beautiful yet eccentric girls. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Later, Midori learns that the boy she owes her gratitude to is Rei Ichijou, one of her new classmates.\n\nShortly after their classes begin, Rei stops showing up along with his friends, Yukinojo Ieiri and Chihiro Goshima. Midori discovers that the three boys are shrouded in shady rumors, but she can scarcely believe any of them. Would a bad person have helped her when they could have simply chosen not to?\n\nWhen a careless slip-up leads to the school chairman finding out about Midori's job that she is not allowed to have, she is given an ultimatum. Either she quits her job and has her scholarship revoked, or she helps out the chairman instead—by persuading Rei and his friends to start attending school again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Taking pity on him, Keiko Arisu, his new classmate, insists he should stop, but all Yuuma responds with is a string of apologies. The bizarre encounters continue when Keiko notices a strange girl following her, eerily proclaiming that she wants to suck her brains out. Running in fear, Keiko jumps in a truck's way and ends up hospitalized.\n\nYuuma pays Keiko a visit in the hospital and confesses that the girl she met is his younger sister, Chizumi. Befriending Chizumi, Keiko discovers Yuuma's dark past: he once summoned the devil and became obsessed, profusely apologizing as a form of a wicked offering.\n\nStill freaked out, Keiko returns to school; however, everyone’s brains terrifyingly melt out of their skulls—and according to Chizumi, it is Yuuma's apologies that caused it. Keiko manages to escape before meeting the same fate, but miseries and misfortune that would befall those around the demonic siblings seem like just the beginning.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots: Saikai, Daichi no Ko",

Under the head of Zeus, the deities of Ancient Greece, Norse mythology, and Hinduism, among others, call assembly every one thousand years to decide the fate of humanity. Because of their unrelenting abuse toward each other and the planet, this time the gods vote unanimously in favor of ending the human race.\n\nBut before the mandate passes, Brunhild, one of the 13 demigod Valkyries, puts forth an alternate proposal: rather than anticlimactically annihilating mankind, why not give them a fighting chance and enact Ragnarök, a one-on-one showdown between man and god? Spurred on by the audacity of the challenge, the divine council quickly accepts, fully confident that this contest will display the utter might of the gods. To stand a chance against the mighty heavens, Brunhild will need to assemble history's greatest individuals, otherwise the death knell will surely be sounded for mankind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Believing that Japan has lacked an egoistic striker hungry for goals, Jinpachi initiates the Blue Lock—a prison-like facility where three hundred talented strikers from high schools all over Japan are isolated and pitted against each other. The sole survivor of Blue Lock will earn the right to become the national team's striker, and those who are defeated shall be banned from joining the team forever. \n\nSelected to join this risky project is Yoichi Isagi, a striker who failed to bring his high school soccer team to the national tournament. After choosing to pass to a teammate who missed instead of scoring on his own, he could not help but wonder if the results would have been different had he been more selfish. Using this golden opportunity given by the Blue Lock Project, Yoichi aims to clear his doubts and chase his ultimate desire—to become the greatest striker in the world and lead Japan to World Cup glory.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Fed up with another lousy day at work, Satoko stops by a park at night to have a drink and unwind when a stray soccer ball lands by her feet.\n\nChasing after the ball is a 12-year-old boy named Mashuu Hayami, whom Satoko scolds for being out so late. But soon enough, she learns that evenings are the only time Mashuu is allowed to practice and refine his soccer skills. Due to her past tenure on her university's futsal team and a general concern for his safety at night, Satoko begins to teach Mashuu the basics of soccer.\n\nHowever, the more time Satoko spends with Mashuu, the more she finds herself becoming a maternal figure for the neglected boy. Mashuu himself begins to find solace in their outings, but not everyone may be able to support or understand their odd relationship.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Stone-faced and honest, Ayumu sees no issue with calling Urushi \"cute.\" Although Ayumu likes her, he refrains from confessing and promises himself to first beat her in a game of shogi.\n\nThrough school life and shogi games, the two students have many hilarious and heart-warming adventures. Ayumu enjoys every second with Urushi, but he is still a long way from beating her in shogi. With the commitment he made to himself, will Ayumu ever get the chance to confess his feelings to Urushi?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One particular story caught her eye, about the Baroness Misano defeating the noblewoman Ronia Gavisera and winning the heart of Ronia's ex-fiancé Schneider. After finishing the novel, she couldn't help but wish there had been a more peaceful conclusion—and this was her last thought before she died.\n\nIn her next life, she is reborn as the very same Ronia whom she had pitied. This time however, she resolves to remain free from the conflict between herself and Misano. However, the plot of the novel cannot change, and despite never instigating anything, Ronia is expelled from school, disowned by her family, and her engagement is ruined.\n\nThis is not Ronia's downfall; this is her chance at freedom! Free of her past, she opens up a cafe, leisurely spending her days with a piping cup of coffee. Soon, this peaceful life gains a new splendor with the arrival of four beast-kin, a race of human-animal hybrids. While most shy away from them in fear, Ronia can't help but be enchanted by their fluffiness!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Consequently, he shut himself off from the world and decided to live the life of a hermit researcher, accompanied by his Siberian husky familiar and best friend Pochi. During one of his experiments, he accidentally ends up creating the eternal dew, granting eternal life to him and his loyal friend.\n\nThousands of years pass by before the hermit finally decides to venture outside and go on a journey, where he discovers his powers of magicraft clearly stand out, as the art has long been lost. Having no goal in life, Asley sets out to explore a changed world, gradually growing and changing himself as he encounters new companions on the road. But in the process, Asley also unearths signs of dark forces threatening this new world he is growing fond of. The demon king's revival is not too far off, and the declining faith of the people, most of whom have chosen to dogmatically revere mankind's most powerful fighters instead, have left mankind bereft of the holy heroes needed to combat this threat.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It was as if men were just livestock that served as stepping stones for females in this world. The only exceptions were the game's romantic targets, a group of handsome men led by the crown prince. In these bizarre circumstances, Leon held one weapon: his knowledge from his previous world, where his brazen sister had forced him to complete this game. Leon, who really just wants to to live as a shut-in in the countryside, uses that knowledge to raise a ferocious revolt against the women and handsome men.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",

Apparently this angel, \"Shiro,\" is the partner of the black cat, \"Kuro,\" who is actually a shape-shifting demon. The two are looking for a young human destined to die soon who they can turn into a \"shinigami.\" Although Haru's death was by accident rather than fate, they decide to take advantage of the situation and extend their offer to him.\n\nSix months prior, Haru had lost both his family and memories to a traumatic fire set by an arsonist. Unable to recall his parents and sister, he could not properly mourn them, so he had lived his life with a sense of detachment and feelings of guilt. After learning of Haru's personal history, the angel and demon decide to sweeten the deal: if he cooperates with them as a shinigami and collects the souls of sinners who have escaped Heaven, then when all is done, it may be possible to return him to the day of the fire so he can regain his memories. With that incentive, the contract between them is sealed, and in his afterlife Haru gains a reason to live that is stronger than any conviction he had while still alive.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He studies well and plays around with his friends, but in truth, he does not enjoy either of those activities. Bound by norms, he secretly envies those who do things differently.\n\nThat is until he discovers the joy of drawing. When he sees a painting made by a member of the Art Club, Yatora becomes fascinated with the colors used in it. Later, in an art exercise, he tries to convey his language without words but instead through painting. After that experience, Yatora finds himself so invested in art that he decides that it is what he wants to do for a living. But there stand multiple obstacles in his way: his parents who are hesitant over his unique choices, his more experienced peers, and the study of a subject much deeper than he initially expected.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite the two having different motives, Yuriko decides to lend him a helping hand after going through a myriad of events.\n\nYuriko and Horita's story is just one of the compelling narratives in Subarashii Sekai.

However, Hana Shirasaki is met with an unfortunate case that is the complete opposite. Her classmate Nakajima takes extreme pleasure in bullying and publicly humiliates her in the most appalling ways imaginable.\n\nBy instilling fear and resorting to blackmail, Nakajima intimidates the people around him to turn a blind eye to his dreadful deeds. Even if a brave soul tries to stand up against Nakajima, their efforts would only amount to nothing, as no one would dare support their endeavor.

After spending six years away due to family circumstances, Tsugu is excited to be reunited with her childhood friends—Yuushin, Asari, and Sora—in high school. On the surface, Tsugu believes that nothing has changed since they last saw each other; however, what she fails to see are the cracks that formed in their friendship after they wrote and buried their wishes in the park back then.\n\nAsari's jealousy of Tsugu's popularity at school causes her to start harassing Tsugu, while Yuushin has begun mercilessly bullying Sora in an attempt to deal with the frustrations of his personal life. After witnessing Sora attempt to take his own life, Tsugu saves him and proposes that they run away from home. Believing that his failure to support Yuushin during their childhood is the reason his friend drastically changed, Sora accepts her invitation and promises to become stronger in the future. With nothing more than some money, the clothes on their backs, and Tsugu's now-broken Fender Stratocaster in tow, the two make their way to Tokyo at the break of dawn. Leaving the world they used to know behind them, the two teenagers embark on a journey of self-discovery.\n\nIn the absence of their friends, Yuushin and Asari are similarly forced to confront their inner demons and uncover new sides to themselves. However, the most surprising realization might be that they have not really changed after all...\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: Love Letter",

There is even a weird rumor spreading around in class, claiming that those who successfully spot Shiraishi will be blessed with good fortune for the day. \n\nSo far, the only person who notices his existence is Nagisa Kubo, the girl seated next to him. Unfortunately for him though, Kubo likes to tease him on a daily basis and often puts him into unprecedented and nerve-wracking situations. However, as Kubo's playful antics continue to involve the reluctant Shiraishi, he may soon discover that his youth might not be as boring as he initially thought.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When Sakunosuke Oda takes pity on his living conditions and invites him to become a member of the Armed Detective Agency, an opportunity arises for Akutagawa to finally get a lead on Gin's whereabouts.\n\nUnbeknownst to him, however, Gin is guarded by none other than Port Mafia's wicked leader, Osamu Dazai, and his successor, Atsushi Nakajima—the infamous \"White Reaper.\" To save his sister, Akutagawa must overcome his weakness and sacrifice it all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Relatively good at studies and amiable with his classmates, he puts a lot of effort into maintaining this facade. One day, however, he decides to stop pretending and quits school, developing insomnia as a result of having no daytime outlet for his energy. When taking walks alone at night, he feels marginally better, though he is aware that his inability to sleep should be considered a serious problem.\n\nOn one such walk, Kou meets a weird girl, Nazuna Nanakusa, who diagnoses the cause of his sleeplessness: despite making changes in his life, he is still holding himself back from experiencing true freedom. She says that he won't be able to sleep unless he is satisfied with how he spends his waking hours. When it appears that she has resolved his current worries, Nazuna invites him back to her apartment to share her futon. After a while, unaware that he is only feigning unconsciousness, she leans over him—and bites his neck!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He is the complete opposite of someone like his younger sister Sachi, who is a reflection of her extroverted parents. Thus, it should come as no surprise that Nagi was swapped with another baby at birth.\n\nOn the way to meet his true parents, Nagi encounters Erika Amano, a young social media star. While spending the day with her, he learns that Erika's parents forced a marriage onto her. Later that day, Nagi comes to learn that Erika's fiancé is actually none other than himself, in order to officially be part of each other's family. With the goal to build the pair's relationship, Nagi's biological father arranges for the fiancés to start living together! However, no matter what tricks their parents pull, Nagi refuses to marry Erika. That is because he already has sights set on someone else: the beautiful and intelligent Hiro Segawa.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

If he wishes to, he can even kill people with the sheer terror brought on by these visions. He assumes that his eyes are the reason he was abandoned in New York as an eight-year-old child, but he cannot be certain. He has no memories of his parents or childhood aside from a vague recollection of previously living in Japan.\n\nEver since Kazuya was picked up off the streets, he has worked as a contract killer alongside his feral partner Keith Grangrey. More valuable than the cash he earns from murders is the promise of information turned up by an ongoing investigation into his past. Coincidentally, the two's targets are usually thugs and other low-life criminals; however, they must also eliminate any witnesses to their killings, whether innocent or not. Kazuya has lost count of the number of his victims and has never shown remorse before now—but it seems his feelings have slowly been changing.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Contrary to her bubbly personality and girly appearance that makes her seem mature, she is as inexperienced in love as many others in her year. Although she dreams of a once-in-a-lifetime romance, there is no one who seems to catch her eye in that way—especially not the blunt and strict Yuusei Hidaka, whom she cannot help but clash heads with on a daily basis. Yet, even Hidaka has a soft spot for his little sister, Manami.\n\nIt is simply fate that Yaotome and Hidaka will never see eye to eye—until a near car accident causes Yaotome and Manami to switch bodies! The two try their best to hide their situation, and when a possibility to switch back appears, Yaotome jumps at the chance—but why is Manami so hesitant?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Investigating further, he finds to his horror that his parents have been murdered, and a vision of Kazuto being kidnapped stops him dead in his tracks. Noticing a scar on the kidnapper's arm that resembles the kanji for \"fire,\" Senri vows to hunt down this \"Fire Man.\"\n\nThirteen years later, Senri is no closer to finding the elusive Fire Man, and the visions from Kazuto have long since ceased.

The four—mage Frieren, hero Himmel, priest Heiter, and warrior Eisen—reminisce about their decade-long journey as the moment to bid each other farewell arrives. But the passing of time is different for elves, thus Frieren witnesses her companions slowly pass away one by one.\n\nBefore his death, Heiter manages to foist a young human apprentice called Fern onto Frieren. Driven by the elf's passion for collecting a myriad of magic spells, the pair embarks on a seemingly aimless journey, revisiting the places that the heroes of yore had visited. Along their travels, Frieren slowly confronts her regrets of missed opportunities to form deeper bonds with her now-deceased comrades.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Now, he lives alone in a cramped Tokyo apartment that he rarely exits, poorly coping with depression and a broken heart.\n\nMeanwhile, Tsumugi Sakura attends high school in the distant Kanagawa prefecture. She stands out among her peers due to her gloomy nature and vibrant violet hair. While she is overtly bullied by her classmates, only the handsome Subaru Minazuki will intervene on her behalf, but she is far from grateful to him. Little does she know, Minazuki has his own reasons for singling her out.\n\nAoi and Sakura both believe that life will not improve as long as they remain the same. If only they could switch places with someone else! But when the miraculous happens, they fail to appreciate just how little their situations differ from before. Like tea made from the blue mallow flower, which transforms in color but not taste, the two have yet to change in a way that truly matters.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Orphaned at a young age, she is cared for by the leader of the Yakuza group \"Hibauchi,\" who uses her as a living weapon against his enemies. One day, in despair at the misfortune she causes others, Kuroha throws herself out a window to escape her guardian and captor. However, before she can hit the ground, she is rescued by a youth named Nijisuke Murokawa.\n\nAlthough Nijisuke has been the victim of an unbelievable number of accidents in his life, he refuses to believe in luck—whether it be good or bad. Insisting that all events are the result of mere coincidences, his mental and physical strengths serve as an inspiration to Kuroha. As she attempts to leave the city with the help of Nijisuke and his mysterious companion Hokuto, she begins to wonder if it is her savior who is really strong or if it is her who is very weak. Is it possible for her to take control of her own fate and stop being a tool for others?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To find his way to Wanda, he does something he never thought he could: He joins the dance club. After all, every routine begins with a single step, right?

Every interaction between the two has been unpleasant, with Shikura constantly making it seem like Madoka has ulterior motives to get closer to him. However, as the two spend more time in each other's company, they begin to realize how misleading first impressions can be. As the days go by, Madoka starts to wonder if Shikura may have a cute side to him after all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But when he compliments her, Yoi feels flustered, and the way he looks at her gets her all nervous. He is the first boy to acknowledge her as a girl, and her attempts to distance herself prove futile as he seems to have set his sights on her. While Yoi keeps telling herself that it is nothing serious, even she cannot completely ignore the stir Kohaku causes in her heart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, he vanished one day and never returned; now those blissful days are long gone.\n\nTwenty years later, Chiyoko hates the sickeningly sweet taste of chocolate as it only serves to resurface bad memories. However, after her mother passes away, the store which her father used to run is reopened by a woman who seems to know Chiyoko, and the chocolate she makes is just like that of Chiyoko's father. Could this woman and the bittersweet nostalgia of her chocolates hold the secret of her father's disappearance?\n\nOn the path of self-discovery, Chiyoko learns the importance of moving on from the past, rekindling old passions, and the unbreakable bonds of family.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To combat these beasts, an elite military unit known as the Defense Corps risks their lives daily to protect civilians. Once a creature is killed, \"sweepers\"—working under the Professional Kaijuu Cleaner Corporation—are left to dispose of its remains.\n\nKafka Hibino, a 32-year-old man, is unsatisfied with his job as a sweeper. From a young age, he has aspired to join the Defense Corps and kill kaijuus for a living. After a few failed attempts, however, he gave up on his dreams and resigned himself to the mediocrity that provided a decent paycheck. Nevertheless, when an ambitious, 18-year-old recruit named Leno Ichikawa joins his cleaning team, Kafka is once again reminded of his desire to join the military.\n\nFollowing a chain of unfortunate events and an interaction with the junior sweeper, Kafka encounters a parasite-type kaijuu that forces its way in through his mouth—turning him into a humanoid monster. With his newfound powers, Kafka aims to give his lifelong dream a final try.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, instead of transforming into a beetle at the end of its larval stage, Moriking overcomes the wall of evolution and evolves into a human being! Furthermore, Shouta's beetle pet is in fact an insect king, born every hundred million years. As part of Moriking's trial to become the king of all insects, he must venture out into the wider world and survive. In doing so, he quickly recognizes Shouta as his savior and owner, and wishes to remain with the Aikawa family.\n\nAlthough Shouta has no qualms about accepting a humanoid beetle who can fly and walk on walls, his high school sister Shouko does. Somehow persuaded by Shouta's pleas, Shouko and their parents ultimately decide to accept the insect king into their family. But a huge challenge lies ahead for the owners of this young and attractive beetle: they must help Moriking defeat the other four competing candidate kings to become the lord of the forest, who rules over all the insects in the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 2: Shinrin Shugosha Moriking\nVolume 4: Baito Leader Tetsuzawa: Futou no Nanokakan",

Therefore, it is no wonder that when she spots a cat in danger in her backyard, she jumps to rescue it without a second thought. What follows is a thorough cuddling session as Erina fawns over the sheer cuteness of the cat. However, as she raises the cat to her lips and kisses it, the cat morphs into a man who is stark naked. Overcome with shock, Erina faints.\n\nAfter regaining consciousness, Erina shrugs off her earlier encounter as nothing more than a dream. So when the same cat visits her and kisses her without warning—turning into a man again—Erina is too stunned to react. Adding to her already growing confusion, it dawns on Erina that the man is Akira Nekoyama, an unsociable boy from her class. As unfazed as ever, Nekoyama declares that Erina is now his master—leaving her in a state of disarray.\n\nWhat will come to be of this strange arrangement between a high school girl and a mysterious shapeshifter?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Due to these circumstances, paying rent has become difficult for farmers, resulting in the eviction of many from their land. Two such people who got caught up in this dreadful situation are Amelia, a frail 14-year-old girl, and her servant Connor.  Her family's land was taken away, forcing the pair to struggle while living as vagrants.\n\nHowever, just across the sea, a rather profitable event is taking place—the California Gold Rush. With aspirations of becoming millionaires, Amelia aims to turn both her and Connor's lives around. They decide to travel to America, hoping for a life without ever needing to face hardships again. Katabami to Ougon is the story of two refugees as they venture outside of Ireland, with only their hopes and dreams pushing them forward.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Due to a series of events, Yotarou becomes enamored with rakugo, bent on becoming a shunichi. Yakumo, who never takes apprentices, almost immediately agrees to pass his trade on to Yotarou. Together with Konatsu, a young lady living in the household, they start struggling toward becoming the new hope for rakugo, which seems to be slowly withering away alongside the Shouwa era.\n\nHowever, as Yotarou gets to know his new mentor and \"big sis,\" he notices hints of a dark past in both of them. The environment of the household becomes strained and, at times, scary. Naturally, no hardships matter to the young Yotarou, as his gaze is set upon their mutual future—the future where he becomes the master of rakugo.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After being assigned the seat next to the kind and popular Sachi Fujimori, Arata's first thought is to befriend her. However, months have passed, and she has yet to face Arata. Every time he tries to look at her, she quickly turns her head so that he can only see her side profile.\n\nDespite what her actions may entail, Sachi also shares Arata's sentiment. But one thing prevents her from doing so: her feelings for him cause her to be too embarrassed to show her face! As Arata's outgoing personality shortens the distance between them, Sachi gradually attempts to see more than just his profile in order to finally come face to face with the person she loves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He quits being a doctor soon thereafter and gets a tattoo of Lucifer on his right arm as a reminder of his past crimes.\n\nAlthough Yu returns to Japan, he spends his days drinking. After a night of drunken brawls, he wakes up in a clinic run by Dr. Minatono. This shady looking clinic takes in all patients, even those without insurance or can't even pay but still maintains state of the art equipments. It turns out Dr. Minatono deals with clients, such as the mob, who are unable to go to regular hospitals due to legal reasons and in exchange receives exorbitant amounts of money to help keep the clinic up and running. At first, Yu rejects the job offer from Dr Minatono, but situations keep coming up that keep him busy in the surgery room.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",

From short-tempered coaches to jealous teammates who would spread wild rumors, they all have gradually warped his outlook on sports clubs. Now enrolled in Noukin High School, Yoigoshi is sought after by the school's soccer team due to his popularity and proven skills. However, as Yoigoshi  seeks to avoid the troublesome life of an athlete, he decides to spend his time after school as a livestreamer instead.\n\nOne day, a first-year student named Souma Azemichi tries to recruit Yoigoshi into the kabaddi team. Initially reluctant, Yoigoshi eventually agrees to check out the club. Having low expectations for the obscure sport, Yoigoshi is surprised to see muscular men fighting empty-handed in intense battles. As the attempt to recruit him suddenly escalates, Yoigoshi's only way to escape the kabaddi club is to give the passionate sport a try.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, unlike the other witches, she wishes to pick a non-animal familiar. There's no better companion than Morihito \"Moi\" Otogi—her childhood friend who happens to be an ogre. Morihito is vehemently opposed to being her servant, but he reluctantly accepts his fate after learning that a curse would revert him into a strange cow-tiger hybrid were he to disobey a witch's order.\n\nDue to Morihito's father leaving for a business trip and Nico's mother remaining behind in the Witches' Holy Land, the two teens find themselves living together under the same roof. While Nico is ecstatic to be living with her crush, Morihito finds that her magical antics and overall clumsiness create more problems than solutions. With a prophesied disaster to befall Nico within the year, Morihito must do everything he can to protect her as her bodyguard while also upholding his duties as her familiar.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Getter Robo pioneered the idea of the combining and transforming robot.\n\nMillions of years ago, the dinosaurs were driven deep underground due to the sudden arrival of \"Getter Rays\" on Earth. After evolving into sentient beings, they grew bitter and vengeful at the humans who replaced them on the surface and began plotting their attack on humanity.\n\nFighting against them is Getter Robo, a machine built by Professor Saotome which uses the mysterious Getter Rays as its power source. Piloting it are three strong-willed young men—the violent martial artist Nagare Ryoma, the psychopathic yet highly intelligent revolutionary Jin Hayato, and the hot-blooded judo master Tomoe Musashi. Each controls one of three specially designed combat jets which can be combined together in different forms to form three different kinds of giant robots: the flying, axe-wielding Getter-1, the quick, drill-wielding Getter-2, and the tough, tank-like Getter-3.",

It has been a year since Meika started working for Kouta in exchange for an old favor extended to her by his father. This is all well and good, but it also means that Kouta lives alone with a girl who is a classmate at school and a maid at home!\n\nMeika rarely loses her professional touch when it comes to assisting Kouta, but lately she has been slipping up all too often. Sadly, Kouta is far too dense to be aware of Meika's feelings—which are proving to be increasingly difficult to contain. Every time Meika's heart begins to race in anticipation, Kouta manages to disappoint her by failing to take a hint. However, hopeful as she is, Meika herself refuses to acknowledge her feelings toward Kouta.\n\nNonetheless, one's true emotions can only be restrained for so long—and Meika and Kouta's time spent denying their feelings is slowly but surely running out.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite their differences, they must try to work together to defend themselves from rogue vampires, Ronaldo's murderous editor, investigators, and more—with Draluc dying continuously along the way.",

However, despite his attitude at school, he works alongside his childhood friend Azuma Higashi to combat the brewing injustice in their town. In contrast to Tokio, Azuma is physically capable and rarely struggles against the common thugs the pair regularly encounter.\n\nYet, there are fights that even Azuma will not pick. Choujins—supernatural beings with powers beyond mere mortals—are entities that Tokio and Azuma avoid at all costs. One day, when a previously defeated thug returns to exact revenge, the two are forced into a scuffle. Unable to flee from their foe, the duo injects themselves with a drug that can turn someone into a Choujin.\n\nWhile the dose seemingly has no physical effect on Azuma, Tokio grows a beak. In fear of being seen, Tokio must now figure out how to hide his new identity as a Choujin. But it seems that there are people out there that are angry at Tokio and Azuma's use of the Choujin drug, and they do not seem to want to stay quiet about it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The addition of Kakeru to the place enables Haiji to execute his next step. However, of all the residents, only Kakeru currently knows about Haiji's eccentric plan!

They came up with an efficient and cost effective plan of sending cockroaches and mold to the surface so that the mold would absorb the sunlight and the insect corpses would serve as a food source for the mold.\n\nIt is now the year 2577 and the first manned ship to Mars has landed on the planet and the six crew members are ready for their mission. But what they find are giant mutated humanoid cockroaches with incredible physical strength. The crew members are easily wiped out, but not before sending a transmission back to Earth. Now, humanity will send elite warriors to exterminate the mutated bugs and claim back Mars.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",

The father of the girls is unwilling to accept the deformed twin into his family and so he places her in a sack and disposes of her at a rubbish dump. The baby subsists first on carrion and earthworms and then, later, by hunting the dogs, rats, crows and other animals that inhabit the dump (something she must do regularly since she begins to decompose when she doesn't get a regular supply of blood). After seven years, she leaves the dump and heads for the distant lights of the city—there she will discover that human blood tastes best of all and maybe find out something about the family that abandoned her.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

So when Risa encounters a delinquent—all battered and bruised—on a rainy afternoon, she takes advantage of the power bestowed upon her by her own sense of caution and uses it to help him. What she does not expect is the victim, Zen Oohira, to take a liking to her.\n\nZen checks all the boxes of a typical delinquent; he has an air of nonchalance about him and even owns a motorcycle. Even so, he is oddly cheerful and sweet, going so far as to give Risa a \"help coupon\" as thanks for her aid in his time of need. When an unforeseen episode forces Risa to redeem her coupon, she realizes that Zen can be far more charming than he lets on.

Her blood contains spells that control time, and allow her to fast-forward her own life. Her ultimate technique kicks in only when she dies bloodily—her blood will reform into herself at 27, at the height of her powers, for one minute.\n\nHer guide through the world of normal humans is Kugi Kizutaka, also aged ten. Kizutaka is a genius, and a sociopath. He believes the only way for people to be happy is to be ruled by him and views everyone he meets as a potential pawn, or slave.

Out of the seven, Lucky is the only one who lacks his siblings' talent, earning the ire of his equally talented pianist father, Gakuon. Publicly, the Otogami siblings are known as sextuplets due to Lucky's ostracization from the family following their parents' divorce. Because of his mother's subsequent hospitalization, Lucky now lives with his abusive aunt who treats him like a housekeeper. Despite the suffering he has endured, Lucky still loves the piano and plays it whenever he visits his mother in the hospital.\n\nOne day, he is surprised to find his mother awake and off her medication. She laments that she was unable to give birth to Lucky as a genius, which saddens him—he does not blame anyone but himself for being a failure. When he seeks her guidance, his mother encourages Lucky to prove to his father that the talentless can also play the piano. This inspires him to take the entrance exam for the prestigious Shibuya Music High School, where his unique, albeit mediocre, playstyle catches the attention of Hideo Dada—his father's former teacher.\n\nAfter his admission, Lucky finds himself being tutored by Dada alongside a reluctant Ako Furusu—the class representative yearning for vengeance against Gakuon for pushing her pianist mother out of the spotlight.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

There, she learns that the hair is known as \"Amagami,\" and it gives them the strange ability to sense the minds of fellow villagers. As Kyoko prepares to leave, the residents invite her to their routine stargazing. However, the ceremony is interrupted when thousands of flying objects cover the sky, and the villagers are suddenly struck with a tormenting vision of jet-black hair—eerily contrasting the comforting gold.\n\nIn the morning, it is announced that Mount Sengoku has erupted. The rescue team discovers Kyoko in the debris, now sporting the golden hair coloring of the Amagami. Now, with the unusual phenomenon and the dark visions that the village has seen in deep space, an unknown terror threatens to be unleashed.

She soon awakens to find herself surrounded by even more strangely dressed people in the basement studio of Paradise Kiss—a fashion design club composed of four students from Yazawa School for the Arts. Although it seems like Yukari has been kidnapped, the older students explain that they only approached her to see if she would model their collection for an upcoming fashion show.\n\nBeing a senior with a busy schedule, Yukari furiously rejects the group's offer. But when she drops her student passbook in her haste to leave, the ringleader of the group, George Koizumi, picks it up and uses it as a means to coerce Yukari into considering their request. After hearing about the other members' unbridled ambition, Yukari is inspired to reevaluate her own circumstances and eventually agrees to help them out.\n\nNow as Paradise Kiss' model, Yukari must learn to balance her new responsibilities with her hectic personal life. However, the more time she spends with George and the rest of the team, the harder it becomes for her to avoid getting swept up in the glitz and glamor of the fashion world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Initially, Ushio refuses to remove the spear pinning Tora down, but Tora's unsealed presence summons various monsters who wish to fight him, and by extension Ushio. Ushio is forced to free Tora, who would like to eat Ushio, but dares not since Ushio keeps the spear close by. The series focuses on their relationship, interspersed with battles against mythological foes, and with Tora's attempts to grapple with modern life.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Ignoring the warnings from those around him, Rudo regularly rummages through the town's garbage in search of anything useful or valuable to save from the \"Abyss\"—a massive hole where anything considered trash is dumped, including people. Rudo's biological father was one such person, having been thrown into the Abyss after he was accused of murder.\n\nOne day, after running into a mysterious figure on the way home, Rudo returns to find Legto's dying body on the floor. He is immediately found at the scene by the authorities and is charged with murder. No one believes his claims of innocence, and he is thrown into the Abyss. Instead of dying, however, he finds himself in a strange, foul-smelling place surrounded by monsters made out of trash.\n\nWhen Rudo is attacked by said monsters, he is saved by a man named Engine, who reveals himself to be a \"janitor\"—someone who uses special weapons called \"jinkis\" to combat these creatures. In order to get his revenge on the one who killed Legto, Rudo reluctantly becomes a janitor to fight his way back up and out of the Abyss.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He lands on Earth, but quickly finds himself in danger of captivity by its inhabitants. Fortunately, he is found by an unsmiling little girl named Shizuka Kuze, who feeds him and names him Takopii. Feeling indebted, Takopii decides to do everything in his power to bring a smile to her face.\n\nThe task is easier said than done, however. Shizuka is bullied by her classmates, she does not have a father, and her mother is never home—though the gravity of these issues flies over the naive Takopii's head. Even so, Shizuka does have one source of happiness: her dog Chappy. The connection Shizuka and Chappy share only increases Takopii's desire to make the girl smile.\n\nWhile Takopii's attempts to lift Shizuka's spirits lead to unintended consequences, he is determined to take things into his own tentacles, test his understanding of human beings, and achieve his goal of spreading happiness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

From her radiant smile when she is with her family to the times when sickness ravages her body in the hospital, he records hours upon hours of footage. After her passing, Yuuta compiles her life into a movie to screen at his school, deciding to add a bit of fantasy to the ending of his film, Dead Explosion Mother, with a literal explosion!\n\nFollowing the backlash caused by his supposedly tone-deaf portrayal of his mother's death, Yuuta trudges to the hospital roof to take his own life—but there, he meets a girl named Eri. Captivated by his film, Eri requests Yuuta to make a new  one that will blow the previous out of the water and prove his critics wrong. The movie they set out to make will stand apart by blurring the line between fact and fiction. And of course, it wouldn't be a Yuuta film if it didn't have his personal flavor—just a dash of fantasy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Five hundred years later, the Ichinose Family split from the syndicate to establish the Order of the Imperial Moon—an organization that rivals the Hiiragi Family's reign. As the price for leaving, the Hiiragi implemented a system that aimed to oppress the next Ichinose head at a school they administer.\n\nForced to follow tradition, Guren Ichinose, a sorcerer and potential heir to the Ichinose Family, enrolls into First Shibuya High. While in enemy territory, Guren must hide his true strength at all times, even if this means that he has to endure blows from fellow classmates. Despite maintaining a low profile at school, he catches the interest of Mahiru Hiiragi—the successor of the Hiiragi Family whom he was close with long ago. With news of a chaotic event arising from the shadows, Guren yearns for power but remains ignorant about his acquaintance, who somehow shares the same sentiment.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He has been called \"the grandfather of Japanese alternative comics\" and has influenced generations of cartoonists around the world. Now the visionary creator of \"The Push Man and Other Stories\" and \"Good-bye\" has turned his incisive, unflinching gaze upon himself. Over ten years in the making, \"A Drifting Life\" is Tatsumis' most ambitious, personal, and heart felt work: an autobiographical bildungsroman in comics form. Using his life long obsession with comics as a frame work, Tatsumi weaves a complex story that encompasses family dynamics, Japanese culture and history, first love, the intricacies of the manga industry, and most importantly, what it means to be an artist. Alternately humorous, enlightening, and haunting, this is the masterful summartion of a fascinating life and a historic career.\n\n(Source: Drawn & Quarterly) ",

She has but one desire in mind: a perfect boyfriend. On her journey, Bulma stumbles upon Gokuu Son, a powerful orphan who has only ever known one human besides her. Gokuu possesses one of the Dragon Balls, it being a memento from his late grandfather. In exchange for it, Bulma invites Gokuu to be a companion in her travels.\n\nBy Bulma's side, Gokuu discovers a world completely alien to him. Powerful enemies embark on their own pursuits of the Dragon Balls, pushing Gokuu beyond his limits in order to protect Bulma and their growing circle of allies. However, Gokuu has secrets unbeknownst to even himself; the incredible strength within him stems from a mysterious source, one that threatens the many people he grows to hold dear.\n\nAs his prowess in martial arts flourishes, Gokuu attracts stronger opponents whose villainous plans could collapse beneath his might. He undertakes the endless venture of combat training to defend his loved ones and the fate of the planet itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
            "background":"Dragon Ball has become one of the most successful manga series of all time, with over 230 million copies sold worldwide with 157 million in Japan alone, making it the third all-time best selling manga as of 2015, and the #1 manga series not currently publishing. The series is often credited for the \"Golden Age of Jump\" where the magazine's circulation was at its highest. VIZ Media serialized the manga in English from March 1998 to March 2005 in monthly comic book anthology format; and was later collected into traditional tankobon format volumes from March 12, 2003 to June 6, 2006. To closer follow the English anime localization, the series is split; in which volumes 17-42 are titled Dragon Ball Z and renumbered as volumes 1-26. Other releases by VIZ include the large format VIZ Big Edition, kanzenban cover based 3-in-1 Edition, and a Full Color Edition of chapters 195-245. Other English publishers include Madman Entertainment in Australia\/New Zealand, and the now defunct Gollancz Manga (distribution rights transferred to VIZ) in the United Kingdom. The series is also published in Spanish by Planet DeAgostini Cómics and in French by Glénat Editions.",

            "synopsis":"Shiki Yukitaka is desperate for money, but he makes way too little as a long term substitute teacher. While drinking one evening, a pretty woman asks if he would be willing to assassinate people for 5 million yen a kill. Although Shiki is hesitant, he grudgingly admits that he might do it, provided all the targets are serious evildoers. He soon finds that her offer is deadly serious, when she introduces him to the rest of the team and points them towards their first target. The driver, Yan, is doing this for the money as well. Shiki's partner, Kuzumi, is a cop. He doesn't appear to be interested in the money, but he seems to be driven by a deep anger.\n\nOn Shiki's first mission, things don't go quite as planned. They didn't count on their target's 18-year-old daughter Itsuki being locked up in the house. She's been confined for 10 years, due to her spooky ability to read things from people's minds when she touches them. She claims to want to be their ally, and Shiki is reluctantly made responsible for her care. With the police investigating their crime, is keeping her alive too dangerous? How long will the team be able to get away with continuing their highly paid vigilante murders?\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",

As a result, he is forced to ingest a poison that is supposed to kill him, but unexpectedly shrinks his body to the size of a grade-schooler instead. Now believed to be dead, Shinichi takes up the alias of Conan Edogawa (a compound of the names of the famous mystery authors Arthur Conan Doyle and Ranpo Edogawa) in order to hide his identity and begins his new life as a seven-year-old living with Ran and her private detective father.\n\nMeitantei Conan follows Conan as he continues to solve murder cases, all while slowly working toward exposing the men who shrunk him and eventually restoring his body.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis":"For as long as he can remember, high school student Ichigo Kurosaki has been able to see the spirits of the dead, but that has not stopped him from leading an ordinary life. One day, Ichigo returns home to find an intruder in his room who introduces herself as Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper tasked with helping souls pass over. Suddenly, the two are jolted from their conversation when a Hollow—an evil spirit known for consuming souls—attacks. As Ichigo makes a brash attempt to stop the Hollow, Rukia steps in and shields him from a counterattack. Injured and unable to keep fighting, Rukia suggests a risky plan—transfer half of her Soul Reaper powers to Ichigo. He accepts and, to Rukia's surprise, ends up absorbing her powers entirely, allowing him to easily dispatch the Hollow.\n\nNow a Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo must take up Rukia's duties of exterminating Hollows and protecting spirits, both living and dead. Along with his friends Orihime Inoue and Yasutora Sado—who later discover spiritual abilities of their own—Ichigo soon learns that the consequences of becoming a Soul Reaper and dealing with the world of spirits are far greater than he ever imagined.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis":"Whenever Naruto Uzumaki proclaims that he will someday become the Hokage—a title bestowed upon the best ninja in the Village Hidden in the Leaves—no one takes him seriously. Since birth, Naruto has been shunned and ridiculed by his fellow villagers. But their contempt isn't because Naruto is loud-mouthed, mischievous, or because of his ineptitude in the ninja arts, but because there is a demon inside him. Prior to Naruto's birth, the powerful and deadly Nine-Tailed Fox attacked the village. In order to stop the rampage, the Fourth Hokage sacrificed his life to seal the demon inside the body of the newborn Naruto.\n\nAnd so when he is assigned to Team 7—along with his new teammates Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, under the mentorship of veteran ninja Kakashi Hatake—Naruto is forced to work together with other people for the first time in his life. Through undergoing vigorous training and taking on challenging missions, Naruto must learn what it means to work in a team and carve his own route toward becoming a full-fledged ninja recognized by his village.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

An organization known as the Commission of Counter Ghoul (CCG) has been established in response to the constant attacks on citizens and as a means of purging these creatures. However, the problem lies in identifying ghouls as they disguise themselves as humans, living amongst the masses so that hunting prey will be easier. Ken Kaneki, an unsuspecting university freshman, finds himself caught in a world between humans and ghouls when his date turns out to be a ghoul after his flesh.\n\nBarely surviving this encounter after being taken to a hospital, he discovers that he has turned into a half-ghoul as a result of the surgery he received. Unable to satisfy his intense craving for human meat through conventional means, Kaneki is taken in by friendly ghouls who run a coffee shop in order to help him with his transition. As he begins what he thinks will be a peaceful new life, little does he know that he is about to find himself at the center of a war between his new comrades and the forces of the CCG, and that his new existence has caught the attention of ghouls all over Tokyo.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis":"Hundreds of years ago, horrifying creatures which resembled humans appeared. These mindless, towering giants, called \"Titans,\" proved to be an existential threat, as they preyed on whatever humans they could find in order to satisfy a seemingly unending appetite. Unable to effectively combat the Titans, mankind was forced to barricade themselves within large walls surrounding what may very well be humanity's last safe haven in the world.\n\nIn the present day, life within the walls has finally found peace, since the residents have not dealt with Titans for many years. Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert are three young children who dream of experiencing all that the world has to offer, having grown up hearing stories of the wonders beyond the walls. But when the state of tranquility is suddenly shattered by the attack of a massive 60-meter Titan, they quickly learn just how cruel the world can be. On that day, Eren makes a promise to himself that he will do whatever it takes to eradicate every single Titan off the face of the Earth, with the hope that one day, humanity will once again be able to live outside the walls without fear.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, even with all its benefits, magic can also be used for great evil; therefore, to prevent dark forces from upsetting the natural order of things, there exists a system of magical guilds in the Kingdom of Fiore. Under the command of their respective guild masters, these guilds are made up of witches and wizards who take on various job requests to earn fame and fortune. One particular guild stands high above the rest in both strength and spirit, and its name is Fairy Tail.\n\nIn his quest to find his dragon foster father—Igneel—Natsu Dragneel, a fiery and reckless mage, and his partner Happy run into a young celestial mage by the name of Lucy Heartfilia, who reveals that it's her dream to become a full-fledged wizard and join the Fairy Tail guild. After rescuing her from an abduction attempt, Natsu offers her a home in Fairy Tail. Now a member of the guild, Lucy teams up with Natsu and befriends fellow wizards Gray Fullbuster and Erza \"Titania\" Scarlet. Together, this motley crew set out on their many adventures, gaining many faithful allies and deadly foes along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite appearing to wander around, the pure-hearted girl aspires to fulfill one precious wish: to reach a particular place. But for it to be granted, she must learn how to heal the wounded hearts of the people and collect them in a magic bottle.\n\nHowever, the world can be confusing for such an innocent girl. Her companion Ioryogi can be quite rough in teaching her common sense, especially for a talking blue dog plushie! Luckily for Kobato, a certain quaint place with a troubled history seems to be—and may be looking for—a glimmer of hope.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One of the most infamous students is first year Tatsumi Oga, called \"Demon King\" by those he's defeated. \n\nOne day, while Oga is finishing off a gang that attacked him, he stumbles upon an infant. In a rare moment of kindness, Oga tries to care for the baby. As a result, the child becomes overly attached to him. In a panic, he brings the baby to his best friend Takayuki Furuichi's house. While there, they are attacked by Hildegard, a demon maid who says the baby is actually Kaiser de Emperana Beelzebub IV. She also reveals that he was sent here to destroy humanity, on a whim of his father Beelzebub III, Great Demon Lord of the Demon World. After failing to remove Baby Beel from Oga, she declares that he must raise him, as moving more than 15 meters away will result in instant death for Oga.\n\nWith his delinquent past and unfriendly nature, Oga must deal with the burden of raising a demon baby. Beezelbub follows his story through encounters with demons and dangerous classmates, all while being an unorthodox role model and carer for the young Baby Beel.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Finding himself in an awkward situation, Haruto must now tolerate spending his high school days alongside this clumsy, freeloading klutz. However, as their relationship deepens, his heart slowly wavers between Yuzuki and his not-so-secret infatuation—his classmate, Nanami Kanzaki.\n\nLife in the countryside may be slow and simple, but the troubles that await Haruto are as complex as a city skyline. Relying on the irrefutable unpredictability of time, Kimi no Iru Machi illustrates how a single day can unexpectedly bring strangers together while another can abruptly break them apart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 6: Yuna",

Ten years have passed since that fateful day, leaving Raku's memory of her faded. But he still holds a relic of their relationship together—a locked pendant, which his childhood friend holds the key to. He hopes to reunite with her one day, despite not remembering what she looks like.\n\nNow a first-year student at Bonyari High School, Raku attempts to live a normal life, dreaming of becoming a public servant and marrying his crush Kosaki Onodera. However, this isn't as easy as it seems, as he is the unwilling heir to a large yakuza family, and Raku can't escape from his duties when the American Bee Hive gang wages war on his family's turf. In order to forge peace between the two feuding families, Raku is forced into a fake romantic relationship with Chitoge Kirisaki, the beautiful daughter of the Bee Hive's leader. The two quickly come to hate each other, but have to learn to live together and pretend to be deeply in love in order to keep their families at bay. \n\nHowever, Raku's quest for the key to his pendant isn't becoming easier as more girls—who were all involved with his pendant in some way—enter his life. Join Raku as he juggles his false relationship, maintains the balance between warring families, and unravels the identity of the girl who will unlock his heart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With her parents often away from home due to work, Hori has to look after her younger brother and do the housework, leaving no chance to socialize away from school.\n\nMeanwhile, Izumi Miyamura is seen as a brooding, glasses-wearing otaku. However, in reality, he is a gentle person inept at studying. Furthermore, he has nine piercings hidden behind his long hair and a tattoo along his back and left shoulder.\n\nBy sheer chance, Hori and Miyamura cross paths outside of school—neither looking as the other expects. These seemingly polar opposites become friends, sharing with each other a side they have never shown to anyone else.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

During this time, Saitama realizes he is neither getting the recognition that he deserves nor known by the people due to him not being a part of the Hero Association.

These powers manifest themselves in the form of visual cues and range from lie detection to danger prediction. Unfortunately, high school student Tooru Mizushima is one of the very few without an Iris. As an \"Iris Zero,\" he is frequently bullied, and therefore, he tries to stand out as little as possible.\n\nHowever, when the popular schoolgirl Koyuki Sasamori comes crashing into Tooru's life, his motto of minimal exposure is brutally shattered. Koyuki's Iris allows her to identify the most qualified person for a certain task—and she determines Tooru to be the most capable person to help her find the next student council president.\n\nTooru refuses to become involved in such a public affair, but Koyuki's cheerful persistence ultimately prevails. And so, Tooru's lonely life as an Iris Zero slowly changes as he comes to meet more people and utilize his exceptional deduction skills to solve various mysteries.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Every year, five hundred students take a graduation exam, where only 20 can pass to become honorable \"begleiters,\" a position equivalent to assistant executive officers. Students fight their enemies by using \"zaiphon,\" God-given abilities that take different forms depending on the individual.\n\nTeito Klein, the academy chairman's favorite student, is belittled by his peers due to his previous status as a slave. Despite being unable to fully remember his past, Teito's cheerful best friend, Mikage Celestine, stays by his side. After the two undergo the exam, Teito recalls small pieces of a long-forgotten memory, causing him to instinctively attack the chief-of-staff, Ayanami.\n\nSubdued for his insubordination, Teito is imprisoned for further questioning. But with the help of Mikage, Teito escapes to the Barsburg Church in the empire's Seventh District. As he struggles to escape the clutches of the Barsburg Empire's military, he unveils the memories that lie within him and learns about a compelling power that roams in the shadows of the empire.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 17: Seven Ghosts (pilot)",

However, just as humanity nears defeat, their champion, the hero Emilia, successfully brings Satan's conquest to a standstill. This quandary forces him to retreat to a random world known as Earth, alongside his most loyal general, Alciel.\n\nVowing to one day return, Satan decides to recover his powers in this new world. Unfortunately, Earth ends up being devoid of invaluable magic. Even so, he remains undeterred from his goal of world domination. To cope with the disadvantage this world brings him, he disguises himself as a human named Sadao Maou. Moreover, he starts to work part-time at a fast-food restaurant, while Alciel finds a way to restore their magic reserves. Soon enough, however, Satan realizes that he wants to conquer both Ente Isla and Earth.\n\nThus begins Satan's journey of becoming a full-time employee and climbing to the top of the corporate ladder. Yet, Emilia suddenly appears, throwing cold water on his plans once again, declaring that she's going to finish him off for good.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He has no friends and isn't even interested in any of the girls he knows. He's also teased due to the fact that he loves shoujo manga. Unlike the harem daydreams of his peers, he dreams of finding his true love. Unfortunately, a shinigami comes to kill him, simply because he's a \"forever alone\" sort of guy. When he gasps out his intention of embracing life with his final breaths, though, she takes it back! As long as he follows through on his intentions, he won't be killed.\n\nTo convince the shinigami that his plans are genuine, he declares that he will confess to the girl he likes, the very next day. Expecting failure with confessing to random girls in his school, he sends out love letters to four different girls. To his surprise, they all agree to be his girlfriend. Now, this shoujo-manga-loving guy has ended up in a kind of harem story, quadruple-timing four girls! Will he be able to stay involved enough with society to avoid an early death?\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
